       " Row(content='As a mental health counselor, I can attest that this has less to do with depression than it does anxiety. Some of the best techniques for treating anxiety are to confront those fears directly through imagined or in-vivo experiments, much like the one the author alluded to about the subway. This is called exposure therapy. Our brains, for whatever reason (evolutionary or otherwise) are predisposed to process negative information first and foremost. For example, in a group with my clients I may ask them \"what went wrong today?\" and they\\'d supply their answers. Then I would ask them \"what went right?\" What they don\\'t realize is that this isn\\'t about the content of their answers; I\\'m actually timing them in my mind to see how quickly they respond. 9 times out of 10 they can supply the negative much more quickly than the positive. Because we are predisposed to avoid negative outcomes, we come to avoid any situations which may lead to negative outcomes, and thus an anxiety disorder may result (agoraphobia, social anxiety, etc.). \\n     Depression, on the other hand, is more about negativistic vs. realistic but hopeful thinking. As the author suggests, if we could just \"think positive\" and alleviate our depression I\\'d be out of a job. The problem is that overly positive thinking does not ring true for us, and so it does not take hold for us emotionally. For example, I could walk around telling myself \"I will succeed at everything I try\", but 1) as a realist I don\\'t actually believe that, and 2) even if I did I\\'d be in for a rude awakening on a daily basis. The irony is that it is just as silly for me to say to myself \"I will fail at everything I try\", but not only am I more likely to believe this (as negatives such as past failures are more easily retrieved from memory as evidence), but also this syncs with my emotional state (sadness/self-loathing) and so I may then allow this thought to take hold and drag myself deeper into the spiral of depression. Both thoughts are outlandish, but the negative one is more likely to impact us, and that is a key point in terms of depression. Only through meta-cognition (thinking about our thinking) can we work to catch ourselves when we begin to think this way, and substitute realistic and hopeful alternative thoughts such as \"I will have my successes and my failures, but even in failure I can succeed by learning from my mistakes\". Counselors and therapists do not teach depressed clients to ignore all the negatives, they teach clients to acknowledge and appreciate the positives they have long been ignoring.', summary='Anxiety is about confronting negative expectations and realizing they are often overblown.

Pros do have more equal skill levels than the average soloq game, but if a champion is completely broken then the average player can abuse it just as much as a pro player. \\n Tell me, why do I have 3x as many games played on Zed, TF, and Nidalee but all of them have 30% less winrate than my Kassadin? Because Kassadin is a patently stronger pick, not because I play it better. I know far more/am more comfortable playing Zed/TF/Nidalee than Kassadin, yet my Kassadin winrate is super high. Clearly there are different tiers of champions, however, I\\'m not advocating to only play those champions. \\n If one enjoys playing the champion, then go ahead and play it. In soloq, there\\'s a bonus edge that a player has by playing an uncommon champion. Like how everyone assumes Poppy is terrible then get bursted down going \"where the fuck did that come from?\" But that champion might not be as powerful as a meta champion. For example, compare Gangplank and Lulu top. Is there anything Gangplank does significantly better than Lulu? Except for providing global ult support, there\\'s nothing. Lulu has more damage, utility, range, safety, and can better utilize teleport. If one wants to win, one should always pick Lulu over Gangplank unless you have never played Lulu before and Gangplank you have 100x as much experience.', summary=\"Different picks are probably stronger than other picks.

They are also making it harder for industry to stay in america too and I think that it is intentional!  Now lets see....  all of our INDUSTRIAL companies, have moved to India, or China where regulations are more lax.

It's hard enough to route ~1k signals on a 16 layer board. If you want 5k, you're talking about having a thick, expensive board with more layers than most places can manufacture. That ignores the size of the chip too. For a replaceable CPU, you have to take those 5k connections and get them to a pin or a pad (with the pins on the motherboard like Intel does). An LGA-1366 CPU is 1907mm^2, extrapolating to a 5k makes the CPU 6980mm^2 or about 83mm x 83mm (3.3 inches square). \\n Even if you forget all of those considerations, one of the main reasons why manufacturers don't do this is that to add in all this space for compatibility is that it would actually make things more expensive for everyone. If they leave all that space in their current design, they have to re-spin the chip to add the new functionality in anyways so why waste silicon on leaving in a 5 year old memory controller when they can remove it and make the new chip smaller which gives them better yields and makes the final product cheaper? In addition, you'd have to do the same thing for motherboards. You'd have to have DIMM slots for each type of memory that you want to support because as the memory speeds get faster and/or your densities change, the layout considerations change. So the motherboard manufacturers would be wasting space on one or more DIMM slot groups just for forward compatibility. To top it off, these motherboard manufacturers wouldn't be able to actually test whether their boards support the future memory types since  they don't exist yet  and therefore have nothing to test against to ensure compatibility. \\n To take your SATA example, the reason you can have compatibility is that serial communication is simple enough that you can use the same wires (data pairs and grounds) and just make better serial communication controllers to signal at higher and higher speeds while retaining the ability to talk at the slower speeds. You can't use serial communication between a processor and RAM. Well you can, but it'd be dog slow since we can't run at clock speeds fast enough to get the bandwidth needed. They could standardize on a bus width, but you still have different timings and voltage levels to deal with. You could standarize on a controller format and that's kind of what happened before the CPU manufacturers started putting their RAM controllers on their CPU die. With LGA775 you can select between motherboards with DDR2 or DDR3 support. The gains that AMD saw using an integrated memory controller were too great for Intel to pass up and so they followed suit. \\n The main reason though is the pace of progress and expected life of the product. A roadway is designed to last decades so it has all kinds of margin built in. Ethernet infrastructure is expected to last at least a decade (probably at least two) so it was built with future compatibility in mind. Also, adding a few extra copper wires to a bundle is almost infinitely cheaper than adding a few hundred extra pins to an ASIC. CPUs double in speed about every 18 months and manufacturing nodes get smaller. This combined with the fact that pretty much every transistor on an ASIC has to be accounted for in order to keep yield at a decent level means that it doesn't make sense to build future compatibility in to an ASIC.\", summary=\"CPU and motherboard manufacturers aren't conspiring to get you to spend $200 every 3-5 years for new memory/motherboard.

       " Row(content=\"Ok, this will be a bit long winded and rambling, but you really asked a big set of questions with your post. I'd be happy to answer any other specific questions you might come up with... Without further ado... \\n The PowerXCell is basically a non-starter these days. IBM has pretty much abandoned the Cell processor as a platform. Another thing to note, is the first system to really use this processor for high-performance computing, Roadrunner, is being decommissioned this year. Besides, the Cell could only muster about 200 GFlops single precision with a single Cell. This can be easily achieved with a GPU these days. At one time, the Cell was a marvel in terms of speed and efficiency and was the apple of high-performance computing's eye for a year or so, but it was quickly eclipsed by GPUs. The Cell's programming model was good in some ways (the Altivec-like SIMD was really nice) and bad in others (PPE vs SPE programming and the fact that SPEs had such limited memory. DMAs could also get complicated...) \\n Now, onto GPUs, to a first order approximation, AMD and NVidia GPUs are very similar. They can even share a programming model in OpenCL. (More on this later) AMD and NVidia trade the pure hardware spec crown back and forth every few months. The thing that NVidia has going for it is the entrenchment of the CUDA ecosystem. CUDA was developed a few years back as an easier way to program GPUs. Previously, before CUDA, you had something generically referred to as GPGPU, or General Purpose [computing] on GPU. As one might expect, GPUs are built to do the math commonly found in graphics operations very quickly. The way this math is arranged lends itself to massively parallel processing with very wide memory paths. \\n It was realized that many other problems share this same sort of structure, so it was possible to sort of encode your own problems in such a way that the operations the graphics pipeline provided did the math you wanted. Sometimes, massaging your problem into the graphics pipeline was a bit difficult and the calls you had to make had nothing to do with how you might logically lay out your problem. However, the speed gains were quite substantial, so people did it. \\n Now, the graphics card guys realized this and decided to provide an API to let people use the hardware built into the GPU in a more generic way. Through a few iterations and other systems, eventually NVidia came up with CUDA. CUDA opened up the doors to hundreds of projects getting big speed gains by using the massively parallel hardware on the GPU. CUDA is purely an NVidia invention and therefore completely controlled by them. There was a push for having a more open, consortium controlled generic API for GPUs and other accelerator devices. Thus, as championed by Apple and oddly enough, NVidia, OpenCL was born. \\n OpenCL is a standard interface to multicore devices, not just GPUs. There are bindings for CPUs, GPUs, and the Cell. It looks quite a bit like CUDA with a few differences, extensions, and a whole different nomenclature. All that aside, what it does allow you to do is create portable applications that run on any OpenCL compliant device (kind of). \\n Both AMD and NVidia (and even Intel) provide OpenCL runtimes for their devices. Write your app one place, and you can run it on the others. The downside of OpenCL is (in my opinion) performance portability. Yes, you can run something anywhere, but it may only run well without changes on one platform. OpenCL provides an abstraction of the hardware, but at the end of the day, all of the performance is in how you end up using the hardware. The same optimization techniques that work for AMD may not translate to NVidia or Intel. Also, because it is an abstraction, there isn't always support for the latest hardware features in the OpenCL runtime. This is mostly a problem when trying to run OpenCL stuff on Nvidia. The latest CUDA may support cool new NVidia hardware features, but they will not be accessible via OpenCL. If you want to use them, you will need to use CUDA. Depending on what your problem needs, this may or may not be a problem.\", summary=\"My suggestion - Start out with OpenCL on AMD. Once you get things working, get some top-end NVidia hardware and run it there. See which one is better. Check out CUDA's features to see if there is anything in there that may work better with your problem. \\n Finally, check out Intel Xeon Phi.

If the option settles to cash, shares of the underlying never change hands and, instead, the party on the losing side of the trade pays the party on the winning side.  So, how does this work?  Say for example you buy one option to buy 100 shares of IBM stock at $100 and upon the option\\'s expiration the price of IBM goes to $200.  The person on the other side of the trade pays you ($200 - $100) * 100 shares = $10,000.  So, why would someone choose to trade the IBM option instead of just buying IBM stock?  This has to do with the implied leverage in a derivative.  To buy 100 shares of IBM at $100, you need $10,000.  However, to buy the $200 option when IBM is trading at $100 requires a lot less money.  For the same amount of money, you can get a lot more exposure to IBM which has roughly the same economics as simply borrowing a lot of money and buying IBM stock.  So if you think IBM is going to $1000/share, then it makes it easy to get a lot of exposure with a smaller capital outlay.  The downside is if IBM doesn\\'t go past $200 (the \"strike price\" of the call option), then you lose all your money. \\n Derivatives also give you the ability to make trades (or bets, depending on who you ask) based on changes in things that are either iliquid (don\\'t trade that often, like real estate), are difficult or costly to trade (interest rates), or which cannot be traded at all (weather and volatility).  Such derivatives are generally structured with both parties agreeing that at the end of each trading day, the party on the losing side of the trade will make a payment to the party on the winning side of the trade.  For example, if Party A wants to bet that interest rates will go from 3% to 4% and Party B wants to bet that interest rates will stay at 3% or drop, both parties enter into an agreement whereby Party A agrees to pay Party B $x for each basis point by which interest rates increase above 3% while Party B agrees to pay Party A $x for each basis point by which interest rates decrease below 3%.  This requires less cash on hand than buying Treasury Bills (betting interest rates stay the same or drop) or shorting Treasury Bills (betting that interest rates will increase).  This approach also lets you bet on interest rates besides Treasury rates (ie interest rates on pools of mortgaged backed securities) which is helpful when the interest rate you want to bet on is not reflected in an easily purchased or shorted product.', summary=\"Derivatives give you implied leverage/lower your capital outlay and let you trade underlying assets which aren't liquid/tradeable on their own.\", author='lawyersaurus', subreddit='explainlikeimfive', tickers=['IBM'], sentiment=0.0073394495993852615),\n",

       " Row(content=\"At some point, you just sort of run out of things to do. The purpose of summoner spells are to provide the most basic functions for stats. \\n e.g. ignite is basic damage/healing reduction, flash/ghost are basic mobility, barrier is basic shield, heal is basic heal, exhaust is basic cc, clarity is basic mana regen. \\n The only truly unique summoner spell -sort of- is Teleport. There's just a tremendous amount of pressure involved with creating a new spell that every champion in the game has access to that's simultaneously good enough to be a viable option for the majority of champions (god forbid something be niche) and not good enough to be incredibly broken. The amount that a good summoner spell would effect the game would be immense. \\n For example... \\n Summoner Spell - Freeze \\n \\n Stuns opponents for 1 second \\n \\n Sounds pretty basic, right? However, it would completely shift the meta and upset the balance of power. It'd be used on champs who suffer because they currently lack hard cc, and would be a massive buff. It would be godly on tons of champs who rely on hard-to-hit skill shots to open up their combo (Swain, for example). All in all, it'd be sort of a mess. \\n Tweaking the rarely used ones? First of all, I think there's a lot more diversity of summoner spells than you think. In the average game, it's perfectly common to have ghost and teleport on your top laner, smite and flash on your jungler, ignite and flash on your midlaner, barrier and flash on your ADC, and exhaust and flash on your support. It's not altogether too uncommon to see heal either, especially on things like Soraka. Cleanse is pretty common as well, especially if the adc has low mobility and is up against a high CC duo, like Jinx/Leona or Ashe/Zyra. \\n So, that leaves three summoner spells that are truly rarely seen. \\n \\n Clairvoyance - This is probably the one you could make the most convincing case to be buffed, along with blue trinket. That said, if you really did need the temporary vision, you'd just go ahead and buy the blue trinket. A trinket slot is much less valuable than having flash is. \\n \\n Clarity - This is a summoner spell that's just flawed in concept. By limiting it to champions that use mana and actually need mana, you instantly make it a niche pick at best. Because of its high CD and unreliability, it's not good enough to fix mana problems for any champions anyways, and it scales awfully if you end up buying an actual item to solve those mana problems. In the endgame, Clarity will be nigh useless. Ignite or Barrier, however, scale extremely well. \\n \\n Revive - Stupid for obvious reasons. It's basically the summoner equivalent of Runic Blessing (or whatever that new shield defensive mastery is). It depends on you dying a decent amount to actually get value out of it. And, you know, dying in general isn't the right thing to do. The respawn timer won't come in handy all the time, and it's on an extraordinarily high cooldown, so you're basically using a summoner slot to provide potential utility and homeguards.

You\\'re no good to anyone. \\n Job: \\n She needs to make sure that she isn\\'t doing this because she hates her current job or is bored with it. She also needs to be honest with herself and know why this job specifically. Does she have a chip on her shoulder? Does she lack self confidence or pride? \\n I know someone women seek out jobs like that because they feel like they need to change the image of women or that they feel untested and need to prove themselves (men do this too).

The mechanic world has been a huge sausage fest for a while. A lot of women come in with a similar mindset. I havent met one yet that hasnt been able to understand the work or physically been able to do it, but for some of them it was all about feeling empowered and/or \"proving the men wrong\". Eventhough they could do the work, they were horrible to work with and they didnt help the process at all. Law enforcement doesnt need that right now. \\n Her kid: \\n I (27) have an 8yr old son. When I was in my early 20s I worked a horrible job i hated and have pretty much always had low self confidence. I toyed with the idea of joining the military to prove something to myself. Fortunately I talked to enough people that helped me realize that my #1 priority in this world is my son.

Your child presumably has regular contact with their mother who\\'s probably fairly normal, but her child wont have that and growing up through infancy with a mother whos very rarely ever home and may be emotionally unavailable is a recipe for a child/adult who has a very hard time forming any real/intimate connection with another human being. \\n She will also see how inefficient the system is/can be.

These ideas were confirmed by a few major events, such as the Lisa Race, Wozniak fading into obscurity and admitting that he and Jobs were \"never close friends,\" Jobs being formally dismissed from the company for a short period, and other upsetting fiascos.

Of all game platforms, games on social networking sites have experienced the largest growth over the past three years and greatly skews the result. In my opinion, social networks are platforms in themselves and should be positioned apart from pc gaming in the graph. \\n \\n When discussing GPU processing power, don\\'t let the number of Hz fool you. It depends a lot on the architecture of the GPU - If it can run two simultaneous processes at 500 MHz, would the result equal one process at 1 GHz, or would the net gain be greater? It all depends on the operations being performed. \\n \\n When comparing GPUs, which PC GPU is being referred to? My Macbook pro has a discrete AMD Radeon GPU working at 675 GHz, and the majority of both laptop and stationary PCs are entirely without a separate GPU and use integrated graphics processing that use the CPU for performance. (For instance; The \"average\" Dell Inspiron 620 Desktop with Intel HD graphics processes graphics at between 500-677 MHz) \\n \\n \"Time spent on each system\" is a very strange measurement. The time spent on a PS3, XBOX360, or a Wii, is all dedicated to entertainment (including someone watching movies, etc), but on the PC that time is not dedicated time at all. Most of the time spent on game consoles is spent on actual gaming, while time spent on the PC includes anything from paying your bills and browsing Facebook to filing TPS report spreadsheets in a cubicle. \\n \\n The \"Consoles and Lack of Reliability\" section doesn\\'t use PC statistics for comparison. My guess is that the failure rate of a PC system after two years is far greater than the console ones. - Especially when taking software problems into account (including reboots due to windows acting weird). \\n \\n When regarding \"The Future of PC Gaming\", comparing sales during a single month (a month with a huge PC release and a very poorly marketed console release) is misleading at best. \"The best-selling console game\" of all time is actually \"Wii Sports\" with a total of 38.93 million units sold in North America alone.

I haven\\'t had a chance to use Windows 8 yet, but I\\'ve maintained confidence in MS\\'s ability to deliver something worthwhile with Surface Pro.  (Also, they don\\'t have much choice.  They have $60B on hand and will just keep hammering away at it.) \\n Here is a quick write up of my thoughts: \\n \\n Surface Pro : The real turning point with the iPad was putting an ARM CPU together with the power management of a mobile OS.  MS has apparently improved the power management of Windows 8: faster start up and shut down times, etc.  But the slate design with an x86 CPU is still going to get relatively worse battery life for the size/weight. \\n \\n Surface RT : It\\'s a bit early to get on board with this, unless you want to enjoy watching things develop from an early point.  Productivity is a solid feature, so I can understand why the Surface RT will appeal to people. \\n \\n iPad : There are two reasons why the iPad works in enterprise.  First, executives frequently have to be responsible for reading a lot of email and/or document processing (reading, editing, critiquing, etc.).  This applies to CEOs, airline pilots, etc.  Second, some corporations use specialized services that either are represented in the app store (CRM software, e.g.), housed on corporate servers, etc.  The main thing about the iPad is that almost every major online service is represented in the app store -- services that are widely used by corporations, small businesses, and the self-employed.  The notable standout is probably MS Office, and, IMO, the absence of MS Office has a palpable effect. \\n \\n \\n So, in brief, regarding Surface, I would look at battery life and power management to compare the Pro, the RT, ultrabooks, etc.  The iPad for work is something that is relatively dependent on the employer or profession. \\n Finally, Android is not a viable option right now except in relatively specialized circumstances.  Google is playing a bit of catchup in the tablet space; they\\'re more reactive than pro-active.  So, outside of ChromeBook, they haven\\'t gone after the productivity market at all as of yet, but they may make a move soon.  The thing to look for is what Google decides to do with their recent purchase of QuickOffice.  Basically, acquiring QuickOffice represents Google\\'s recognition that Google Docs requires a relatively sophisticated local client app.  But hardware wise, Android doesn\\'t have a work-appropriate tablet form factor -- MS and Windows OEMs have a half dozen, while Apple has either one or two, depending on how you look at it.. \\n Personally, I still have confidence in MS, even though they\\'re not exactly a sexy company.  Office 365 is a potentially formidable service, the acquisition of Skype makes sense for the productivity market, and MS Office is still standard.  The problem they are going to have is the branding of \"RT\" devices.  The media is still pretty confused about the whole thing.  (MS claims that \"RT\" doesn\\'t mean anything; I assumed it meant \"RISC tablet.\"  Neither alternative is very helpful for consumers.) \\n Anyway, I hope that was helpful.

Not to say that Modern is no skill, but it\\'s just that there are certain elements in Legacy that make the game more complex. Two key examples: \\n \\n Legacy has Wasteland (and to a lesser extent Price of Progress and Stifle). I cannot overstate how much this changes the entire game and differentiates the formats. In Legacy, every land you play (or do not play) matters. Greedy manabases are punished, the first land you play can fuck the game up for you, fetching a land is not always \"okay\" and getting Wasteland locked (ex. Loams, Knights) is a real thing. Despite having access to the best colour fixing in the game (ABUR duals + fetches) having a greedy mana base can screw you over hard; similarly, fetching the wrong land can lose you the game. \\n \\n Stack interaction, and this is of course partly because there\\'s more blue in the meta. But cards like Brainstorm, Force of Will, dredge triggers (ex. Nacromoba), Aether Vial, Death & Taxes (yes, the whole deck), Snapcaster, Abrupt Decay, Dark Ritual, etcetera all exist together in this format where combo/control/aggro are all real archtypes. Learning how to properly play the stack and when to pull the trigger on things matters a hell of a lot when a vast majority of key staple cards are all instants and, additionally, when you need to prepare to face some of the most efficient counterspells in the entire game. \\n \\n \\n Overall, I\\'d say that the Legacy meta is less linear. Yes, you\\'ll see a lot of the same cards in every deck (Force, Swords to Plows, Goyf, etcetera) but there\\'s a lot of variation in shells and how the cards are used. While these staples might seem somewhat stale, subtle little changes in a Legacy deck along with the occasionally introduction of new cards (ex. Deathrite Shaman) can change everything. You also have the added benefit of using obscene cards to metagame the shit out of things (see, for example, Nic Vit using Veteran Explorer and Tin Fins using a weird combination of things). Due to the deeper cardpool and a lack of a \"turn 4 rule\" you also have true combo/control/aggro decks that tend to work in less of a sort of mythical rock-paper-sissors manner and more in terms of a truly fluid meta (ex. Dredge usually beats Maverick game 1 unless they manage to stall long enough with Taalia, but games 2 and 3 depend on the sideboard and the variation of hate/counterhate in both decks). \\n \\n Not a big fan of Modern. Like I said, I have the cards for it, but I\\'m not really willing to touch it yet. There are too many restrictions and not a deep enough card pool for my liking. Until the B&R list gets figured out and they let me play fast combo (turn 1-2) I won\\'t be touching it (note: I understand that some people love this though, which is totally cool, too). \\n \\n See above. \\n \\n -- \\n \\n Another 5 years worth of cards, a solidified B&R list and a decision on what sort of direction Modern is taking and I -MIGHT- consider dabbling in it. \\n \\n -- \\n \\n Not quite familiar enough to comment here. A lot of eternal players are saying that blue needs more of a presence, though, be it UU Counterspell, Jace or something similar. \\n \\n Liberal in the sense that they\\'re not as scare as, say, Candelabra or Power in Legacy/Vintage. Conservative enough that values don\\'t (totally) tank and piss people off. In other words: $150.00 Goyfs? Probably too much to see format growth. $50.00 Goyfs and the potential to open them in packs every 3-5 years? Maybe more reasonable and it won\\'t piss people off like values yo-yo\\'ing up and down might (see: Yu-Gi-Oh!). At any rate, cost for both Legacy and Modern along with reprinting is a big, big issue. \\n \\n Trial and error with the banlist. It\\'s going to change a lot until Wizards figures out what works. They\\'re caught in a bind with Modern: they want a format that\\'s accessible to typical Standard players without having the speed and aggression that sometimes scares people away from Legacy. In doing this, and having a sort of implicit turn-4 rule, it means that the B&R list will be wonky for a while. Like I said, this works well for some people because it\\'s exactly what they want. It doesn\\'t work so well for other people like me who don\\'t mind having some ultra fast and aggressive decks floating around. \\n \\n Reprints, I think, are the obvious answer. I\\'m not going to touch that though and instead I\\'ll say a removal of stereotypes and, in some cases, the stigma associated with Legacy are big issues, too. There\\'s this big myth that says that \"Legacy is dying\" and \"all of Legacy is broken turn-1 kill decks and you\\'re not allowed to play Lightning Bolt in the format because it doesn\\'t do 20 damage on turn 1.\" Both of these are false... Legacy is not dying and Legacy is not full of broken, degenerate turn 1 decks. The latter myth, especially, seems to really turn people away without exploring the diversity of the meta. Ironically, I\\'ve met some people who claimed Legacy was broken because they didn\\'t attempt to metagame and their tier 2 standard deck got crushed by established Legacy decks. I ask: \"Did you look at older cards to improve your deck before entering the tournament?\" They go: \"Well, no, I should just be able to win without needing to do research!\" ...You see why this sort of myth making is toxic. \\n \\n For Legacy: www.mtgthesource.com; don\\'t go to Salvation or anything, the legacy on TheSource is usually top-notch and has some well regarded Legacy players writing on the forums. From there sometimes there are more specalized sites you can visit (ex. Storm Boards if you\\'re playing Storm combo). \\n \\n \\n Also check out  to get an idea of the metagame and sometimes awesome links to videos of the deck being played by pros.

Humans have a certain cognitive capacity The idea is cognitive capacity and it means, on a basic level, that we have a finite amount of things we can keep track of at once. Once we go past this limit we start to under preform on tasks.\\nIn complex tasks such as sports what we see is that with practice and experience we can \"keep track of\" more things at once. \\n Think about attacking the A bombsite on nuke for example. A newer player will find it difficult to keep track of just where all the CT\\'s are shooting them from. Watch a poorly done upper rush. Players look like they have no idea what is going on. \\n Professional players are not only reacting to newly arising conditions, like the above, but thinking about meta conditions as well. Good teams will be able to predict where the CT\\'s will rotate from based on \\nknowledge of the setups they have played so far and experience from any past attempts at a rush. At the same time, they are also dealing with the immensely complex, precise motor tasks of shooting and aiming. \\n The point here is that the mental tasks are immense when we break them down (this is not really extraordinary, it is so with lots of activities, esp. other sports).\\nThe reason that we practice our aim is to free up our cognitive capacity from the tasks of shooting to think about the \"metagame\" (The larger game.) The ability to do this is the difference between a smart player and \"stupid\" player. \\n In contrast, the reason we \"simplify the game\" is to FOCUS our cognitive capacity on the task of reacting quickly to a stimulus (a peeking CT). \\n simple decisions take less time\\nLet me put this in source terms. \\n If you are awping from arches on inferno and jump out in the middle of mid, you have got a lot of places to look. (see fig1) Those places to look turn into decisions on some level. you have got to DECIDE where to fling your crosshair, before you shoot. \\n 1)PEEK \\n 2) PERCEIVE \\n 3)DECIDE \\n 4)SHOOT \\n fig 1: \\n If you instead peeked from left to right, first looking alt(fig2), then car(fig3), then spawn, then bench, you would have only one place to shoot if you see an enemy at an given time. Now bear with me, because this even is a simplification, but the game you are palying now has less steps. You are peeking an angle. Your crosshair is positioned to kill if a person is on that angle. So now the game is \\n 1)PEEK \\n 2)PERCEIVE \\n 3)SHOOT \\n fig 2: \\nfig 3: \\n Now, the research shows that if we reduce the number of possible actions one might be asked to take, ESPECIALLY if we reduce it to one, then reaction time decreases.(no cite but its common sense). \\n fig 1: \\nfig 2: \\nfig 3:', summary=\"simplify things; if you're gonna peek out into a hallway don't just jump into the middle and hope for the best, peek anywhere that opponents could be in logical order one by one, this will beat out raw aim 100% of the time\", author='aybrah', subreddit='counterstrike', tickers=['META'], sentiment=0.0),\n",

The main thing to consider when training T2 weapons is apart from that extra 5% damage and subsequent 2% damage per level from the the specialization skills is that you are training for T2 ammo.  Weapon systems are different and the degree of advantage that the T2 version of the ammo provides is different. \\n It is quite easy to get away with T1 artillery weapons for instance because the difference between faction EMP and Quake damagewise is very insignificant. EMP is the shortest range ammo yet still has significantly more optimal range than Quake, better tracking and the very minor damage difference that Quake provides is made up by the fact that EMP deals EM damage which is a common resist hole. Essentially the only advantage Quake provides is the ability to shift damage into Kinetic/Explosive resistances with penalties to range and tracking and the small damage bonus from the weapon specialization. With this in mind even if you have access to T2 ammo you are probably more likely to use faction ammo anyway for the role of close range ammo. The other T2 artillery ammo is for extreme ranges, ranges that aren't really useful in PvP unless you are doing some sort of cheesy sniping doctrine or coordinated long range alpha as people can just warp off. \\n This is different for pulse lasers or blasters. Given it they are close range weapons scorch/null give you a significant advantage in range and much more damage compared with any other type of similar ranged ammo. The main drawback to close range weapons is not shockingly their range and the T2 ammo helps to negate this drawback. Conflagration/Void which is the T2 close range ammo doesn't really do all that much as it deals the same damage type, has reduced tracking (which is a huge deal at the range you are fighting it as transversal velocity is higher assuming your opponent isn't completely retarded), either more capacitor consumption or reduced falloff all for minor damage boost compared with faction ammo.

       " Row(content=\"I have been playing the battlefield series since bf2, I think in general the games are pretty good, though recently they have been going down hill especially with the release of bf4, which is an absolute train wreck even though it's months after release. \\n My next major bf experience was bad company 2, and I got into that after my cod4 stage, needless to say it felt great and in my eyes it was the best bf experience that could ever exist, it didn't really have any severe bugs, it looked great and played great, the classes were all balanced just like the guns (with the exception of the laser shotgun slugs). A lot of complaints happened because of a few features missing (prone, jets) to name a few, but I didn't really miss them that much. \\n Going back to the game the other night after playing the severe disappointment that is second assault, I found it pretty fun still, though I did have some issues, the fov felt too low, I like it around 70-85 depending on the game, which as a result makes everything feel slow, like sprinting and such. There was no option to change it that I could see. The lack of strafe sprinting also made it a but more difficult but not impossible. \\n Some nice things were a lack of a cluttered HUD, all of the flag icons are nice and tiny and don't clutter my screen with the alphabet. The visuals were pretty nice too, nothing super fancy, no computed glasses were needed to offset an overdose of certain colours. The hit detection also felt really good, I wasn't getting shot after going into cover or anything silly like that, and definitely no random one shot deaths from anybody, it felt fair when I died. \\n Overall I still find the game to be great though it could use some improvements. \\n Battlefield 3, where do I even start with this, firstly let me get my coloured glasses so I can see properly. Bf3 is good fun, I have over 400 hours in it and for the most part enjoyed a lot of it, it looks nice and runs okay, most of the guns are balanced now, and it's fairly stable, there are a few good maps but only a couple great ones worth playing (caspian, and kharg) both of those maps are good for getting knife kills (knife being my number 1 weapon). \\n Now as much as I have enjoyed bf3 it's not without problems, hit detection seems to be a bit of a problem, not to bf4s extent but still bad, most with getting shot after being in cover, it's a lot better that it used to be but I think it could be improved some. Some more guns could be balanced, the aek and m16 are rampant through the game because they are so easy to get kills with, I personally don't use them because I like engineer, rather than assault, the rocket barrage from the jets are annoying, same with the heli rockets, especially when you get terrible players exploiting the ceiling height, which is one thing bf4 did right, limited vehicle ammo and reduced heli ceiling. Suppression is annoying but once you get used to it, it's not that bad. \\n In general I do feel like it was money well spent. \\n Now on to the child everyone expected to be great, but turned out to be a drunk wife basher, battlefield 4. I'd you have been online in the past few months you have probably seen mention if the train wreck that is the game, it is full of problem months from release, every patch brings just as many problems as are addressed, and in general just isn't that fun. Before I continue with all of the negatives, I should run through the short list of positives, the game does look nice, it does run a bit better than bf3 does for me, med-high graphics, the audio in the game is amazing as always, dice know how to get their audio right, with one exception, the DMR 'tsh tsh' sound, holy fuck that's annoying, now the vehicles do feel a lot better especially the little bird, the way it moves nice, the limited weapons was a nice touch and stopped a lot of vehicle whoring that was rampant in bf3, the lower heli ceiling was a good touch too, the boats are a great addition they are fun to cruise about in but are still vulnerable if you don't sort your shit out. The maps are okay, if say there are a few more good ones in the base game than there were in bf3 though I would say they aren't as great as the good maps in bf3. \\n The problems with bf4, now I will try to list some that aren't as big of a mention, we all know the game is still full of bugs and glitches, some if which are incredibly dumb and shouldn't exist in the first place. Balancing, now this game is almost balanced but there are some issues, for some reason DMRs got a 25% buff recently which is beyond me, they are way overpowered as it is, they do too much damage, and because of their semi auto nature, can be fired very quickly, that in combination with having very easy to control recoil means you can just spray rounds and kill a ton of people, it's annoying to go down to someone at close range because they got their 2-3 shots off with a dmr and I can only get one round off with my pump action shotgun. Explosives also need to be adjusted, the v40 minis they are just as lethal as normal grenades, yet you get three, most people will run with then just because of that fact, on the other side most rockets feel too weak, running around with an RPG which is meant to be the most powerful launcher, still feels weak, it now takes two rockets to take down an attack heli, what the hell is that rubbish, I feel like an ant chipping away at tanks even when firing at the rear, speaking about launchers, why are there do many lock on type of launchers, it feels cheap and takes no skill. \\n Other weapons are also weak, most machine guns feel good enough, the slower firing ones for the most part hit harder which is how it should be balanced, pump actions could use a buff, while semi autos could have their damage output reduced and recoil increased. The knife, what an absolute joke, they took what was a great system in bf3 and crapped all over it, the counter knife is beyond a joke, why am I being punished for getting close enough to a player that isn't good enough to shoot me, if I run directly at you and you fail to kill me with a gun then you should be the one punished. The animations take too long, and I can sit and wait to be countered for ages before it happens because the other player gets an insane advantage, a flashy press button prompt, which is always the same button, all of which is up for more than enough time that even a sloth could react to it in time, also where is my knife slash, why of all things change that it worked fine in bf3, the knife lock on is broken and still allows the other player a bit of time to shoot me off them, and you have to be almost inside the opposing players character for the lock to initiate, in bf3 it was about a meter and that was fine. My crew used to knife all the time in bf3 because it was fun, seeing people rage because they were incompetent enough to shoot me before I reach you was so satisfying, now we don't even bother because dice couldn't handle being stabbed and decided to punish players with a bit of skill in favor of those that suck at the game. \\n Levolution, what a joke that turned out to be, I recall then saying it would change the way the game is played, now I would say only one map does that well, flood zone, to me that levolution does as advertised, the map gets changed severly, other maps however are pitiful at best, look at dawn breaker, one tiny bridge in the middle of the map can blow up, what about golmud railway nothing even happens, or that little tower in operation locker, what the hell where they even thinking they do nothing for the game in the slightest, where was all this enchanted destruction that was promised, buildings are just as destructible as bf3, which felt a lot less than bad company 2. The first dlc released didn't even feature levolution, after all of that advertisement about how great it is, we get four new maps that are just standard maps with nothing going on for them whatsoever, second assault did a bit better with some minor levolution but even still it's nothing drastic, caspian is a bit better in that regard but I expected much more. \\n The game in general seems to favor the less skilled, and punish those with skills, Everything feels like a chance, and then you get silly things like battlepacks, what a backwards idea, I don't even have to do anything and I am rewarded, what happened to earning things, not in this game everything is given away, and now they just recently gave away all handguns and dmrs, great work guys reward crappy players with more stuff, the game is no where near as fun because I don't have to do anything challenging, the game does all the work for me, in just over a hundred hours I am a higher rank that I am in bf3 and I have over 400 hours in that, how is that right, with all of these double xp events and 200% boosters you can rank up in no time, what's funny is people still say others have no life for  being rank 110, even though it takes nothing to rank up. \\n Overall I feel like I have been ripped off with bf4, paying for the game and premium at Aussie prices, which are even more of a joke. I am severely disappointed in dice and can't understand how a AAA company can fuck up this bad, it's like they hired a bunch of junior game devs right out of uni, and then made a bet on how badly they could screw the game. \\n Before I forget here are my PC specs, because I do mention them. \\n Amd fx 8320 eight core\\nNvidia gtx 760 4gb\\n4gb ram\\nAnd I was running it on an 128gb ssd but I have since moved it to my main hdd to make room for titanfall, a far superior and more fun game. \\n Profiles for those that care... \\n Bf3 profile: \\n Bf4 profile: \\n I have written way too much but whatever, I also did this on my phone, what a damn pain.\", summary='BC2 - good, BF3 - good, BF4 - bad.', author='NORecker', subreddit='Games', tickers=['AMD'], sentiment=0.0),\n",

To avoid that, Seal Dragons is still quite fun to play and can pack a punch even without a break ride (though if he can afford the Dauntless Drive Dragons, he\\'ll help to future-proof himself with the clan since it will be using that breakride for quite some time). \\n A decklist might look something like this: \\n Vanguard:   Seal Dragon, Terrycloth  or  Lizard Soldier, Conroe \\n Grade 0: \\n 4x Seal Dragon, Shirting (Heal) \\n 2x Seal Dragon, Artpique (Draw) \\n 2x Gattling Claw Dragon (Draw) \\n 4x Seal Dragon, Biella (Crit) \\n 4x Blue Ray Dracokid / Embidoment of the Spear, Tahr / Demonic Dragon Mage Raksasha (Crit) \\n Grade 1: \\n 4x Seal Dragon, Rinocross (Perfect Guard) \\n 4x Seal Dragon, Flannel \\n 4x Seal Dragon, Kersey \\n 2x Seal Dragon, Chambray \\n Grade 2: \\n 4x Seal Dragon, Jacquard \\n 4x Seal Dragon, Corduroy \\n 3x Seal Dragon, Hunger Hell Dragon  or  Bellicosity Dragon \\n Grade 3: \\n 4x Seal Dragon, Blockade  or  Dauntless Drive Dragon \\n 4x Hellfire Seal Dragon, Blockade Inferno \\n Estimated Cost:  ~$40 for the perfect guards, and he can use the Barris that he already has in the interim, plus ~$25 for the grade 3s.  The rest of the cards are either common or regular rares and should be negligible. \\n About the Deck: \\n Much like Kagero in general, Seal Dragons aim to gain advantage by retiring your opponents units.  Their costs are generally cheaper, but with the drawback that they use especial counterblasts (which is why you want as many seal dragons as possible in the deck) and they give your opponent a chance to replace their lost units with grade 2 units. \\n Many players might turn their nose up at your opponent getting \"free\" grade 2 units instead of getting full-on retires, but that\\'s really only an issue if you\\'re retiring grade 2 units in the first place (which you shouldn\\'t be).  You should be using effects of Terrycloth and Corduroy to retire the opponent\\'s boosters or grade 3 attackers if no boosters are left.  Sometimes the retire will yield a grade 2 replacement and sometimes it won\\'t.  Grade 2s, however, cannot boost, and grade 2s anywhere but your front-left and -right RG circles are basically dead zones for your opponent.  This means that either your opponent minuses by retiring that unit to play another one, or they are stuck with weak columns. \\n Now what?  Once your opponent has a field full of grade 2s, your own grade 3s come in.  Blockade stops all intercepting, making those grade 2s in the front row as useless on the defensive as any other grade is.  Crossride into Blockade Inferno and for a CB2-<Seal Dragons>, he retires  all  of your opponents grade 2 units,  and  gains +10000 power.  These two things are not mutually inclusive, and you can counterblast for the power-up regardless of whether or not you end up retiring anything. \\n It gets better.  Did you hit any heal triggers throughout the game?  Got 4 or more seal dragons face-up in your damage zone?  Do you know that your opponent doesn\\'t have a perfect guard?  Blockade Inferno\\'s skill is an ACT, and you can stack the +10k power-up as many times as you can pay for for a devastating final attack, or use it multiple turns in a row to drain your opponent\\'s guard that much more quickly. \\n A few things of note:  If you find that you never have enough counterblast open for Blockade Inferno, you might consider tech-ing in a few Bellicosity Dragon (the Kagero damage unflipper), but that runs an even greater risk of having non-seal dragons in your damage zone.  If you add in Bellicosity, I\\'d do so at the expense of Gattling Claw Dragons, replacing them with more Artpiques to keep the same trigger ratio but to balance out the lower count of Seal Dragons.', summary=\"Seal Dragons, go!

       " Row(content=\"Guys, even Phil said that DX12 is not a game changer for XO. To understand this you need to better understand the state of Graphics performance on the PC. [DX12 Not Game Changer for XO]( \\n Desktop Graphics \\n To understand the direction of directX you need to know a little history about graphics libraries. Known the direction they have taken will help you better understand the approach that DX12 is taking. \\n Going back a few years you have DirectX(Direct3D) and OpenGL as the primary competing desktop graphics libraries. In these early days graphics libraries really wasted a lot of time on the CPU leaving the graphics card idil waiting for instructions. \\n I'll use OpenGL for this example since its the graphics library I have used the longest. \\n   // Draw a triangle\\n  glBegin(GL_TRIANGLE);\\n  glVertex3f(-1.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f);\\n  glVertex3f(1.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f);\\n  glVertex3f(1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\\n  glEnd();\\n \\n You don't necessarily need to understand the above, but let me explain what is going on here. This is what is known as immediate mode. Meaning that every call to the graphics library is a direct call to the graphic card. There is no batching so each command in the above makes the journey to the graphics card on its own. This is terrible. If you understand the concept of the driver and how it is  a software interface to the hardware, your driver on your computer is doing a lot of work to transfer these very small commands.Meanwhile your graphics card is just waiting, doing nothing. \\n Over the years graphics libraries got smarter. They updated their APIs to provide a batching interface where you could draw thousands of triangles with very few calls to the API. Simply, fewer calls to the driver equal less of a performance hit by the driver. \\n Example of Modern OpenGL \\n // Allocate space for 1000 triangles on graphics card\\nGLuint vbo;\\nglGenBuffers(1,&amp;vbo);\\nglBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER,vbo);\\nglBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, *size of 1k triangles in bytes*, GL_STATIC_DRAW);\\nglDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES,0, *number of indices to draw 1k triangles*);\\n \\n Now, this example might seem a little strange but it reads like this. Create a location on the graphics card to store vertex data (vbo), allocate the space, and send the data in one command from the cpu to the gpu. Then draw the 1k triangles with a single call. If you compare this to the code in the first example you can see how this greatly reduces the overhead of the driver by reducing the number of times the program needs to communicate with the graphics card. However, this doesn't actually solve the problem. The driver is still a performance hit every time you send commands to the graphics card. \\n Graphics Driver \\n What is a graphic driver? Well, OpenGL and Direct3D are really specifications. Microsoft(Direct3D) and OpenGL ARB gather and discuss how their interface should work. For example, if you call X, then it must leave Y in a specific state. These specification are then handed over to hardware manufactures like NVIDIA or AMD. They take these and really build out the library on the graphics card. However, think about this. The software vendor writes a specification that is really up to the hardware vendor to implement. That is DirectX(direct3d) and OpenGL focus on writing software, while the hardware has to make it happen. This is where you get some of your overhead. This is also why you get different performance on AMD or NVIDIA drivers between versions numbers. \\n Additionally, software developers don't think in terms of hardware. For example, it might make sense in your program to use a single BYTE to hold a color component. However, the interface of hardware normally prefer 4-byte aligned data. Meaning that if you send over 1byte each time the driver must pad the data with an additional 3bytes of data. While this is transparent to the user, this is performed in the driver and adds a cost to the driver call. \\n So, why do we need a graphics driver? If it is such a pain and causes so many performance penalties why can't developers bypass it and write GPU instructions themselves? AKA  Closer to the metal . Simply put, a driver is a common interface to the underlying hardware. In this case, the graphics hardware. By talking to the driver we can develop a game with a graphics library like OpenGL and DirectX(Direct3D) and have it run on any graphics cards that support that library. The alternative would be writing assembly for each graphics card architecture (Yikes!!). Simply put, drivers exist because developers need them. the task they perform are priceless. \\n Metal & Mantle \\n If you follow graphics libraries or write games you have heard about the upcoming libraries by Apple and AMD. I want to take a second and quote AMD's reason for Mantle. \\n > Why we developed Mantle \\n > From a game developer’s point of view, creating games for the PC has never been especially efficient.  With so many combinations of hardware possible in a PC, it’s not practical to create specialized programming for every possible configuration . What they do  instead is write simplified code that gets translated on-the-fly into something the computer can work with. \\n Additionally, I would also like to quote \\n >Mantle will ostensibly allow developers to work “closer to the metal”, like they do with console GPUs.\\n[source]( \\n Read those two quotes. While the PC has far superior hardware, it is almost always under utilized because of the performance overhead of the driver. These new API are focused on delivering  console level performance . In short, consoles have been doing this for years. Why do you think games on the xbox360 and ps3 look as good as they do with such subpar hardware? Because they don't suffer the same overhead. Since they know 100% what the hardware is, the job of the driver is almost direct communication with the hardware. The translation done in the driver is really little to none. \\n In short, DX12 is going to bring the PC performance in the realm of consoles. I don't think it will be 1:1, but much much closer then they are today. Anyone who states otherwise is a sales person or marketing person. Their job is to create excitement and get people involved. Facts are not their primary focus. In all honesty, if I trust anyone at Microsoft it is Phil.

For example: last night I was playing in a very evenly matched game vs. a Kraken.  Battles were very back and forth.  He was half health at stage 2 and only 2 hunters were alive with about 45 seconds on the drop ship timer.  We were forced to guard the dead Tyrant body so that he wouldn't regen his health.  Sure enough, being the intelligent monster player that he was, he came looking for it, we staved him off just in time for our trapper to drop in and dome him.

It is also filled predictable-but-not-really plot twists, I was able to grasp some important narrative threads for the entire duration of Muv-Luv but there were always other elements I would not account for and I was constantly second guessing myself, there’s some really solid sci-fi supporting the entire structure of Muv-Luv and that’s what kept me engaged and surprised at every turn to the very end. \\n The idea behind the BETA is something that really got to me, even during Unlimited and Alternative did not disappoint, the biggest worry for me was that the illusion and fear would go away once the showed the actual monsters but they managed to keep them scary and that is due to many reasons that lie at the core of everything that is Alternative. \\n The first one was the actual military setting, it’s very well handled, war should be inherently scary and because Alternative is second to none, no matter the enemy you are always at the edge of your seat,  MLA Spoilers \\n MLA Spoilers \\n Lastly the ending, it was probably the hardest part to pull off and what would make or break the idea of  MLA Spoilers   despite all odds  And the result is eerie. \\n MLA Spoilers \\n I guess the real, final answer to the question: How do you keep the monster scary after you show it? is: You make up another bigger badder monster and don’t show that one. \\n It obviously does borrow from the Deep Ones, but instead of making “blub blub” as they make their way to us, now they come from a place where no one can hear you scream. \\n Like I mentioned earlier, I really liked the characters, not all of them to be sure, and I have only tangentially touched on the many great things about the world building and the political side of things (both self-contained and what applies to our world as well). \\n I really like the approach to politics, it’s fair to both sides, left and right, and stays true to what  MLA Spoilers  said when she talked about points of view and that a leader should be able to see the validity of the opinions in many different sides of an argument, I do think that the VN leans left but it is possible that those are my own biases that give me that perspective. \\n While the nations are sometimes condemned as a whole for their actions they never forget to consider the perspective of the individuals and I always appreciate that. Muv-Luv takes it a bit further and considers the different and opposing ideas even amongst those in power of a single nation, and it does this for both the west and the east, this shouldn’t be refreshing but it sadly is. \\n If I liked Meiya in Unlimited and during Ayamine’s route in Extra then I ended up loving her in Alternative, obviously I went with her “route” here and I don’t even know how it could work any other way, everything felt right into place and it made sense for her to be the closest person to Takeru, and given the plethora of other elements that work in favor of them being really close I might even consider the fact that Alternative allows others to be the “BFF” a huge negative issue, but since I didn’t actually go for them I can’t really pass judgment. \\n It’s not so much that what Meiya said was particularly insightful or deep (though at times it was) . Really WTF was that?! It felt really forced and out of place, they wanted that parallel with  MLA Spoilers  but it wasn’t needed, they already had enough.

I have a lot of thoughts, so I'll apologize if this gets too long. \\n I play TT for a couple reasons - the first one is that I only have two main friends that I really like to play with so it's kind of an obvious shoehorn. Beyond that, though, I think of 3's as a faster, more nuanced way of playing league. Laning, teamfights, objective control, and mindgames all blend together. You're not spending the 20ish seconds it takes to walk to lane figuring out what the enemy is going to do - you don't have that luxury. Without vision control, you have to be playing your own game as well as playing the enemies game to figure out what to do. \\n This ties into why I play 3s over other maps - it's more fun  all the time . I'm always getting to do something and the stages of the game blend together in a really natural way. \\n What don't I like about 3s  - Not enough people play, so you're either playing ranked for practice, or you're dominating normals. Normals just aren't a valuable experience. If you have a team, and you are ranked even as low as silver, you're going to stomp in normals, so there isn't much room for practicing new things and being able to gauge how competitive they are. \\n Changes for improvement  - this is a hard one, because I think that things are in a really healthy place meta-wise right now. Unlike earlier in the season, it seems like jungle, bruiser/sup, and adc/sup comps are all viable and in a kind of rock/paper/scissors configuration. That said, I think the adc/sup comp is slightly favored in all matchups as they can bully bruiser/sup out of lane, and with a hard cc sup they can shut down jungle ganks. \\n Perhaps more regular review/ update of item updates as they change for SR would be helpful, too. I can recall a couple of times (most recently with Luden's) where items on SR were unavailable or horribly op (release quillcoat with the ward) because they weren't vetted properly for TT. \\n On top of this, I think that TT should double down on its identity. Unique items and visually jungle monsters that look like they belong on the treeline would be a very welcome addition. The VU on SR gave us jungle camps that really popped and felt at home on the rift - can we have something similar for 3s? Creatures that feel more spooky (like vile) would be really awesome. \\n Speaking of vile  - I think the spider is in a great spot save for the ranged blind-spot. I know a lot of people may disagree with me on this one, but I don't think any unit should be able to solo an epic monster with impunity. \\n Altars  - these are also in a good spot. My only thought is that maybe there should be a greater reward for stealing back an altar from a team that previously had both. That is to say, the risk of taking back an altar sometimes doesn't outweigh the reward, especially when the enemy team  has  the buff. Usually, it's a better idea to turtle and wait for them to make a mistake. Following the teamfight, you then try to cap an altar. Perhaps if there was an incentive to at least take one away even in these situations, it could lead to more play incentive/ variety. \\n Towers  - towers either feel like adamantium or butter, and right now they're doing weird things with aggro. Sometimes they'll hit you for longer range than it feels like it should. Every once in a while, they'll target a champ before a minion.

       " Row(content='I\\'ll agree with your whole middle portion. Although, I\\'m pretty sure the lowered testosterone level could be explained from the whole obesity epidemic. \\n Funny you should say that, because large amounts of BPA has been cited as a slight causative factor in the obesity epidemic (among various other things of course). Everything is sort of muddled here and causative relationships might not really exist when it comes to a lot of things; more A -> B, and B -> A type stuff. Vicious cycles, and all that jazz. \\n You also compare BPA to cigarettes. Here\\'s the thing, we (that is to say, the collective we, including laymans) actually know that cigarettes are bad for you. But not many people know that BPA exposure from stuff like touching thermal paper is also bad for you. \\n > If it were as dangerous as you think it could be, wouldn\\'t there be more studies linking it to, well, dangerous things? \\n There are more and more studies  every day  saying that it  is  dangerous. It\\'s also one of those pesky \"unknown\" dangers. The meta-analysis you speak of completely ignored all the findings that  did  show harm at lower doses and didn\\'t use the old outdated (and heavily inaccurate) protocols for testing. This is like saying  screw using lasers to break up small kidney stones, let\\'s cut that bad boy out  and saying laser therapy is wrong for not cutting a patient open in need of kidney stone removal. \\n Alsom people are ill informed and that\\'s part of what makes BPA so dangerous. Everyone\\'s always going on about mercury toxicity from fish, but realistically the risk of mercury toxicity from regular consumption of something like salmon is  extremely  low (pretty much impossible) given the amount of selenium also present in salmon (selenium helps prevent methylmercury toxicity by clearing it out of the system). However, the dangers of consumption of BPA from eating farmed salmon is  very  real, but no one really talks about it because they don\\'t have enough information on it. \\n Steps of course  are  being undertaken to limit exposure in some (more progressive) countries, but not quickly enough in my opinion. There\\'s also many politicians  stupidly refusing to sign off  on legislature stating that BPA should be put on the toxic substance list (see: Maine). \\n Then there\\'s the fact that thermal paper/receipts still have ridiculous amounts of BPA in it. From the wiki: \\n > A Swiss study found that 11 of 13 thermal printing papers contained 8 - 17 g/kg Bisphenol A (BPA). Upon dry finger contact with a thermal paper receipt, roughly 1 μg BPA (0.2 – 6 μg) was transferred to the forefinger and the middle finger. For wet or greasy fingers approximately 10 times more was transferred. Extraction of BPA from the fingers was possible up to 2 hours after exposure \\n Remember that ballpark estimating 1ug/kg/day causes damage, and even 0.025ug/kg/day does as well in animals? Wet hands + receipt = 10ug, or 0.14ug/kg/day for the average 70kg person. That\\'s from  a single source  alone... Do you see the same problem I\\'m seeing right now? But of course it must be okay because they banned BPA in baby bottles and nalgenes... /s \\n Also from the wiki: \\n > While the EPA considers exposures up to 50 µg/kg/day to be safe, the most sensitive animal studies show effects at much lower doses \\n We all discovered thanks to WikiLeaks how reliable the EPA can be when our health might be involved (see: the huge decline of the bee population in recent years because of a  known  problem with a pesticide that\\'s decimated the bee population being approved... because of money changing hands).

You will quickly realize that in the standard meta, AP mid and ranged AD bot are the two roles with less variations in their common builds. Mainly because on both of these roles you pretty, much have to maximize damage, and you can pick your options from a limited list only. \\n --\\nEndgame items for AD bot and AP mid: \\n AD:  Infinity edge, berzerker's boots, phantom dancer, last whisper, bloodthirster, defensive item of choice (quicksilver sash or banshee's veil usually). An AD carry has to pack damage to be useful to its team, hence the very offensive build. \\n AP:  rabadon's cap, sorcerer's shoes, void staff (these three items are pretty much core on most APs mid, then you have a few options for your last items). Same reasoning as AD, although you can mix in more defensive items near endgame. \\n The other three roles are the ones where you will see some variation. And that's what makes them interesting to me. Let's try to see what options you got there. \\n Support:  core items for support are shurelya's (at least in my opinion, but even this is debatable), boots of choice (CDR boots, merc treads, or even mobility boots), lots and lots of wards. After these you can build pretty much anything, as long as it benefits the team. So you can go aegis, zeke's, locket, abyssal scepter, wota, randuins, and so on. You need to adapt to the needs of your lane/team. \\n Jungler:  early on junglers get items to help them jungle faster/safer. Then it's usually a mix of damage/survivability, as they'll often find themselves in the middle of fights. There are so many options here I won't get in any details, you need to check out guides to get a general idea. Usually people have interesting theories on their item choices. \\n Top:  again, lots of possible routes for top. On this lane more than on any other lane you need to adapt to your opponent. Stacking defensive stats might be the best option early on, and other times you'll stack damage to get kills and snowball. On passive lanes you can even build gold per 10 items such as philosopher stone or heart of gold to farm up until late game. \\n Finally I'd recommend you indeed check out guides on the various sites people have already mentioned. But be sure to always try to understand why certain items might be better than others in specific situations. Your itemization has to remain flexible whatever your role is, and you need to keep an open mind about it. There are no perfect builds, just optimal and not so optimal choices under given circumstances. Bottomline is, it has to make sense. So be sure to try out as many weird combos as you can, that's how you will get better and understand why some items are crap sometimes and work beautifully at other times. \\n --\", summary=\"Be flexible in your item choices, try out stuff, and don't let people lecture you about the perfect  insert pro name here  build that you should have gone for.

Some champs just seem to work better for how the game is currently being played. \\n Generally, one very strong champion is more of a problem than one under powered champion because if there\\'s an under powered champion, you can play almost any other champion but that one and be fine.  If there\\'s an over powered champion, it severely limits what you can play against it. \\n Take Zyra, for example.  Some people expected to see a lot of Thresh in the S3 World Championship, but Zyra\\'s ability to push hard onto lane and block him when he tries to hook made it so you couldn\\'t play him at all.  In fact, support role was dominated almost entirely by Zyra and Sona pick (except for Tabe\\'s Annie) because Sona can sustain Zyra\\'s poke and answer back in lane, so she does fairly well. \\n Of course, most champions are counterable, but when most people say \"OP,\" they mean extremely good at their meta-designated roles to the point where what you can play in said role is limited to either that champion or a counter to that champion. \\n You\\'re correct, though.  There\\'s a second definition of over-powered.  In the sense you\\'re discussing, a champion is only over-powered if there\\'s very limited or no counter-play.  For example, right now, I think the way Sivir\\'s new W is set up is sort of OP because for only 40 mana she can hit every single minion in the wave and the champions three consecutive times from a safe distance.  Pretty much the only way to not get hit is to stand far enough from the minions that you might miss experience.  This is pretty irritating and might be countered by making the damage decay on subsequent hits (like it used to work) so she can either use it to get harass when there are only a few minions left or use it to farm when a large wave is pushing.  But this, in turn, could create problems with overall viability and negate the work that\\'s been done to rework her twice. \\n Then there\\'s Olaf.  In his current form, when he uses his ult active, he loses increased resistances but gains immunity to cc and offensive stats.

Fewer medical interventions occurred in the home birth group: induction (statistically significant ORs in the range 0.06–0.39), augmentation (0.26–0.69), episiotomy (0.02–0.39), operative vaginal birth (0.03–0.42), and cesarean section (0.05–0.31).\" \\n Social theorists aruge that the move of childbirth to the hospital settings reflects a cultural shift and the power differential of physicians, rather than a genuine need for advanced modes of care. Davis-Floyd (1987) summarizes the philosophy as the \"technological model of birth\", where mothers are treated more as vehicles that have somehow \"broken down\" and require fixing. The qualitative study, which matches my own personal experience, is that mothers are pushed to give birth during the 8-4 business hours of the obstetrician and anaesthesiologist, instead of following the natural course of birth. Also consider the cultural shift in some mothers wanting \"that perfect body\" after birth, or rushing to get back to work despite financial stability at home. \\n The advantage of midwifery-led birth is the continuity of care throughout the antenatal period with a more holistic bent. \\n If you insist,', summary=\"I believe , based on the information that I have gathered, that the option of midwifery care should be given and promoted for mothers of low-risk births.

Knowing the game has been out for 8 years and if you go into 1.6 before that 10+ the game is old and established so the skill level for most is gonna be much higher \\n AND MY CLASSIC REPOST \\n What you should really be learning about is positioning, a lot of the best players in this game don\\'t have that amazing aim but have outstanding gamesense and positioning that makes their aiming skills irrelevant. \\n I\\'m gonna throw out some terms here. Humans have a certain cognitive capacity The idea is cognitive capacity and it means, on a basic level, that we have a finite amount of things we can keep track of at once. Once we go past this limit we start to under preform on tasks. \\n In complex tasks such as sports what we see is that with practice and experience we can \"keep track of\" more things at once. \\n Think about attacking the A bombsite on nuke for example. A newer player will find it difficult to keep track of just where all the CT\\'s are shooting them from. Watch a poorly done upper rush. Players look like they have no idea what is going on. \\n Professional players are not only reacting to newly arising conditions, like the above, but thinking about meta conditions as well. Good teams will be able to predict where the CT\\'s will rotate from based on knowledge of the setups they have played so far and experience from any past attempts at a rush.\\nAt the same time, they are also dealing with the immensely complex, precise motor tasks of shooting and aiming. \\n The point here is that the mental tasks are immense when we break them down (this is not really extraordinary, it is so with lots of activities, esp. other sports). \\n The reason that we practice our aim is to free up our cognitive capacity from the tasks of shooting to think about the \"metagame\" (The larger game.) The ability to do this is the difference between a smart player and \"stupid\" player. \\n In contrast, the reason we \"simplify the game\" is to FOCUS our cognitive capacity on the task of reacting quickly to a stimulus (a peeking CT). \\n simple decisions take less time \\n Let me put this in source terms. \\n If you are awping from arches on inferno and jump out in the middle of mid, you have got a lot of places to look. (see fig1)\\nThose places to look turn into decisions on some level. you have got to DECIDE where to fling your crosshair, before you shoot. \\n 1)PEEK \\n 2) PERCEIVE \\n 3)DECIDE \\n 4)SHOOT \\n fig 1 \\n If you instead peeked from left to right, first looking alt(fig2), then car(fig3), then spawn, then bench, you would have only one place to shoot if you see an enemy at an given time.\\nNow bear with me, because this even is a simplification, but the game you are palying now has less steps. You are peeking an angle. Your crosshair is positioned to kill if a person is on that angle. So now the game is \\n 1)PEEK \\n 2)PERCEIVE \\n 3)SHOOT \\n fig 2fig 3 \\n Now, the research shows that if we reduce the number of possible actions one might be asked to take, ESPECIALLY if we reduce it to one, then reaction time decreases.(no cite but its common sense). \\n fig 1: \\n fig 2: \\n fig 3:', summary=\"simplify things; if you're gonna peek out into a hallway don't just jump into the middle and hope for the best, peek anywhere that opponents could be in logical order one by one, this will beat out raw aim 100% of the time\", author='thespeedofdark', subreddit='counterstrike', tickers=['META'], sentiment=0.0),\n",

Krypton was their secret project- For Eons the Guardians have been creating and then shelving armies to fulfill and impose their will, their sense of justice and order on the known Universe. It started with the Manhunter Robots-The programming was never successful so they ended the program. Then they genetically modified a sentient humanoid species to become physical and intellectual powerhouses. \\n But something went wrong there as well. They had a tendency towards war. This combined with their potential to spread across the universe unchecked resulted in the Guardians deeming the experiment a failure. Their first countermeasure was to accelerate the aging of the Kryptonian Sun. Robbing them of their physical might but of course they still had their intellect and technology.  The Guardians then isolated the system from the rest of the galaxy ensuring they would not spread to other solar systems. \\n Time passes and Unbeknownst to all was that that Darkseid had become aware of the Kryptonians and their potential.

A green Lantern is dispatched to ensure no one leaves the planet.   The Lantern feels conflicted as he watches billions begin to die. On the planet surface, Jor El prepares his sons escape module. He discovered the secret of their genetic code and the power that lay dormant there under a red sun. He and his wife say their goodbyes and their son is sent towards Earth. \\n From space The alien looking Lantern detects the launch of the rocket and its slowly charging hyperdrive. He moves to intercept. He approaches the module and detects an infant life form. Watching a planet die from a distance was one thing. But seeing this symbol of hope and faith being sent into the blackness of space gives him pause. Before he can make any decision he is attacked by a swarm of Parademons. He puts himself between the tiny space craft and the marauding armies of darksied and attacks.  Their numbers are too great and the last thing he sees before succumbing to the parademons final assault is the last son of Krypton disappearing into a wormhole. Its final destination unknown. \\n This is the set up – 28 years later Abin Sur detects a foreign life form on Earth. His ring tells him it’s a Kryptonian. The Guardians are extremely displeased.

       " Row(content=\"Right son, let me tell you a story. Back in the old days, the meta settled on running many bruisers. You ran bruiser/support botlane, your ADC on midlane, a bruiser/AP toplane, and a bruiser in the jungle. These tanky compositions were considered very powerful in the early competitive scene, where skill levels were still low. \\n However, come the Season one championship, the main EU teams used their own meta to considerable success. They moved their AD onto botlane, and moved their AP to midlane. Now there are several reasons for this, and I shall go into them now: \\n First off, having the AD on bot-lane with a support makes the most sense. AD's don't scale off levels, they scale off gold. This means they want to farm all day, and be helped in this endeavour. Conversely, supports don't scale off gold at all, and thus they became natural laning buddies with the AD. \\n AP's, on the other hand, DO scale of levels. Every rank you put in a spell makes them much more powerful. To this end, they wanted to be on a solo lane, where experience could be sucked up to power their spells. Also, as a rule, AP's are better at clearing lanes than AD's, so it was much more possible for the AP to blow his lane to smithereens, and then go roam; allowing MUCH more map presence. \\n To be honest, of all the lanes, top has changed the least. You place one person up there with high personal power. The reason you only put one person there is because otherwise, you're sacrificing too much control of Dragon. This is also the reason why you put the duo-lane on bot, NOT top; dragon control. \\n The jungler plays a double role in the game of league. Ganking lanes is important, and is there most visible role, but their other role is just as important; defending and farming the jungle. If one team has a jungler, and the other one doesn't, with some careful farming, it would be possible for the team with a jungler to farm the ENTIRE jungle, resulting in their team being able to possess 4 buffs, not just two. This would affect the lanes in a way that would usually outweigh any benefits that could be garnered from putting an extra character on the lane. \\n Now, there are some little things inside this meta that changed. For example, the original EU meta was to have two AP's; one on top, one on mid. This was to abuse Will of the Ancients; which was at this point a more powerful item than it is today. However, the US teams continued to run more bruiser-teams, and eventually EU was forced to adopt to the tanky-top meta. \\n As a finishing note, we do see lots of playing around with the metagame. Picture of a Goose, for example, pioneered the return of the Support-Bruiser botlane in the form of Leona-Jarvan; a combo that works to this day. And Moscow 5 experimented with the meta all the time, ussually to take advantage of their highly-aggressive jungler. Sometimes they'd have the support roam JUST as much as their jungler; in fact, for the first 4-5 minuites, the support just ran along-side the jungler, and they proceeded to invade without any repercussions. To do this, they had to run a solo bot AND top lane, which was fascinating to watch.\", summary=\"AP's on mid for EXP gain and quicker lane clear, AD's on bot for gold, Supports on bot because no gold, single man on top in order to maximise cover of Dragon, jungler to both gank AND defend jungle.

       " Row(content='It\\'s really about what is communicated to the rest of us. As far as Allah is concerned, He knows exactly who is or isn\\'t a Muslim and when. He knows the precise instant when one enters or leaves or Islam, even if it\\'s back and forth within a single instant. \\n With regards to the rest of us, we have no insight into other people\\'s intentions. So their word is obviously good, and we affirm their belief (since we have no access to it at all). Actions are different because unlike belief, they communicate information, but unlike words, they do not communicate clear information. So some actions are easily seen for what they are, but even then must be contextualized. Which is why there is the rule of law (Shari\\'ah). A Qazi decides and lets the defendant speak for themselves. Actions can be misinterpreted, no matter how obvious they seem. \\n Logically, everyone can deduce that actions are a part of belief (even non-Muslims). But in terms of law, actions are often not included for this reason, because they do not communicate clear information. A person who abandons Salah but acknowledges that Salah is fardh and that they are sinning and will be punished will likely also be feeling guilty or planning on making it up or something like that (no rational person damns themselves). But on the surface it is impossible to distinguish such a person from a true apostate. \\n It gets more complicated. Actions can contradict beliefs, but in such a case, belief/intent is what a person is judged for. When words contradict beliefs, that is lying, and lying is an action with its own rules. So because words contradicting beliefs is well legislated already (the entire evidence/witness system in Shari\\'ah is built around the words-contradicting-beliefs phenomenon), we have no issues with that. But we are not nearly as prepared for actions contradicting beliefs, because actions are like the \"meta\" case for words (speaking words is an act). This starts to get into the Unseen territory which angels record and Allah can see but we have no access to. \\n Belief is belief. Belief doesn\\'t always have to be put into action because our free will is limited. The fact of our existence proves that belief and actions are two different things and we are less responsible for our actions than we are for our beliefs. Words and actions are only relevant insofar as much as they communicate information about belief. Words are a clearer communication of belief and easier to legislate around. Beliefs determine eternal salvation or not, actions determine the degree (i.e, highest ranks of paradise, lower ranks, or hell before paradise). \\n You don\\'t become Muslim legally by acting as a Muslim but by saying the Shahadah (though Allah can see directly when you become a Muslim in your heart and come to true belief even if you do not say it... so you can become a Muslim theologically but not yet legally). Otherwise someone fasting in Ramadan would be counted as a Muslim, but even non-Muslims fast in Ramadan. \\n The issue of forbidding practicing the religious celebrations of other faiths is about more than this issue. Social concerns are also a matter, law is meant to govern society more than the individual. You have apostated from society by joining another, even though you might not have ever abandoned your faith and might be judged as a believer by Allah. But it is the law of all societies that they protect their own, so they ostracize individuals who undermine the society. So taking actions publicly undermining the basis for your citizenship in a theocratic state is actually treasonous. Some people dislike treating legal apostasy as treason but there is no way to logically separate the two (except by abandoning logic). It is still possible for a person who apostates from Islam and then wars against the Caliphate (i.e, outright treason/apostate) to still be a Muslim in belief, which only Allah can discern. This person can still potentially spend only a limited time in Hell. It\\'s still perfectly reasonable for the society to protect itself from this individual because he is a threat to it. A person can go to a Qazi and denounce Islam but still die as a believer, because we don\\'t know why he did what he did but it\\'s certainly possible for words and actions to not match what is in the heart and only the latter determines the eternal destination of a soul. This reminds me of the story of the guy who had his body cremated or something and the ashes spread far and wide after he died. When Allah brought him back, he said he only did this out of fear of Allah. \\n This is only relevant for \\'aqeedah though because in fiqh, most of the time, people aren\\'t being this clever and their words and actions represent their belief. As Sigmund Freud said, he who does not live his belief, does not believe. It\\'s safe for us to proceed legally on such an assumption because we have to acknowledge we cannot ever have ultimate knowledge, and Allah has allowed us this in order to set up a society and protect ourselves. But regarding a person\\'s eternal destination, a matter of \\'aqeedah, we have to take into consideration all of the above.', summary=\"That's why there's a difference in how 'aqeedah and fiqh treat apostasy.

And what about Nazi Germany? How would this argument have supported the fascistic cause? Could history be repeating itself again? \\n In his book IBM and the Holocaust the investigative journalist Edwin Black details the business dealing of the American-based multinational corporation International Business Machines and its Germany and other European subsidiaries with the government of Adolf Hitler during the 1930’s and the years of World War II. In the book, Black outlines the way in which IBM’s technology helped to facilitate Nazi genocide through the generation and tabulation of punch cards based upon national census data. \\n Hitler came to power in January 1933 and repression against political opponents and the country's substantial ethnic Jewish population began at once. By April 1933, some 60,000 had been imprisoned. On April 12, 1933, the German government announced the plans to immediately conduct a long-delayed national census. The project was particularly important to the Nazis as a mechanism for the identification of Jews, Gypsies and other ethics groups deemed undesirable by the regime. \\n IBM owned 90% of its German subsidiary which was know as Dehomag and through it offered to actively assist the German government in its task of ethnic identification, concentrating first on the 41 million citizens of Prussia. \\n In October 1933 IBM’s chairman Thomas Watson traveled to Germany and immediately ramped up IBM’s investment in its German subsidiary from 400 000 to 7 000 000 reichsmark (about $1 million). This enabled Dehomag to purchase land in Berlin and construct IBM’s first factory in Germany thereby tooling up for what it correctly saw as a massive financial relationship with the Hitler regime. \\n From the aforesaid it is clear that the “nothing to hide argument” is dangerous in its own right. A government, under the auspices of a census, asks its citizens to indicate their religious affiliation and surely that is nothing to hide, right? Then later that government uses the American advances in technology to identify and persecute those with the “wrong” religious affiliation. \\n It is admittedly a bit extreme to compare America with Nazi Germany, but I am sure you get the point – what is innocent and acceptable today, may not be so tomorrow and how do you then retract or hide your affiliations? \\n Many people tend to forget just how permanent their digital tracks are and that is where this surveillance is of concern.

The issue is with the players, not the card. \\n If the issue, which is what it seems, is that people just don't understand HOW to counter or play against a priest, then they either need to play more games and develop strategy, or maybe some OTHER cards need to be added or changed to help balance OTHER classes to Mind Control. \\n From where I'm standing (Masters in Constructed) MC play is easy to counter most times, unless you either play badly (which I've done) or you just don't get the proper cards (which can happen). I've been on both sides of Priest (currently playing around with Shaman, Paladin, Warrior) and playing it is like any class: you NEED to know your cards. \\n You can have the BEST deck out there (hypothetically) but if you don't know your cards, you will fall flat on your face more often then not. The next step is knowing OTHER players' cards and the classes. \\n You either need to study them and learn what their cards do and how they synergize in a deck, or you need to play that class and get a feel for it. \\n Before I played Priest I  was  getting stomped all over with MC, because I didn't have foresight or knowledge to defeat it. Now I do, if I'm going to play something beefy against a Priest on mana 6, I'm going to know I might not get an attack with it (SW:D, or P), or if it survives into mana 8 it might get MC'ed. \\n In both situations you play to what you have in your hand. Having hand dominance is important in ANY match, even if it's more-so against priest. You're probably going to need at LEAST one silence in any deck if you want to be able to counter anything huge that they play, or that they steal/copy from you. \\n Another step would be to play smart, if you are around mana 8 for Priest  always  assume BOTH MC's are in their hands, don't kid yourself into thinking otherwise. I specifically save a silence or another card that can deal with a giant minion or my own minion coming against me for this specific reason when going against priest. \\n Each class has it's different strategies to play against. \\n For Paladin, you better believe I'm not leaving ANYTHING on the board, not even their Hero-Power minion, because they can buff it up to insane levels. \\n Same goes for Hunter, leaving too many things on the field is horrible. As is NOT having a good defense ready for the latest Meta (OTK). You need to be confident in your deck that you can make it work in any situation, and know when to strike. \\n For Mage I'll tend to play it a bit more safe until they use the majority of their removal, but I'll keep board control an asset. You're usually playing against them having good card draw as they want more spells. Anything with spell damage + you NEED to deal with, unless you CAN take the hit the next turn. \\n Warlock, you need to be prepared for a lot of big minions coming out early, and dealing with them. Use their hero power to your advantage and make sure you don't waste your AoE on something tiny. \\n Shaman, don't let them get ahead. They might have good minions coming out fast but they also pay for that the next turn, use this to your advantage. It's really easy to bait a Shaman into using too much overload in one turn and then removing everything they just did, or at least halting them for a bit. \\n When going against Rogue you'll need to be prepared for a lot of combinations and straight-up damage to your minions or yourself. Around mana 5 assume they have both Assassinates and play around that. Instead of playing X, which is the better minion in your hand, play Y if you can to hopefully soak up that Assassinate. AoE is your friend, as a good portion of their minions seem to be low HP and any stealth can be dealt with here. \\n Druid will grow fast, and can be difficult to counter if you're not in the right head. Board control is important and something you'll need to maintain. I always assume at least one innervate in their hand at all times and think what they could play (I.E. it's mana 2, so they could play a 4 mana cost card this turn with innervate, etc.) \\n The point I'm trying to get across is that each class has cards that can be seen as OP in certain circumstances. Right now, it's looking as if Priest and Hunter are being seen as too OP because of current builds and people are making reactionary decks to deal with them and it's not working. \\n Eventually people will learn ways around these cards and strategies as more and more people get the game, etc. \\n That being said, the game is still in beta and who knows what can happen. If they do end up changing MC, something else will keep it's place and the developers know this, so they are taking in much more data then any of us could possibly be getting. If they do decide to change it it's for what they view as the best and we will be testing it out to help balance the game. \\n Until anything official happens, though, please don't whine and complain about the newest popular strategy being OP and complaining it needs to be nerfed right away. Some things don't need to be nerfed, some things do.

Quoting my response from another thread, because you clearly haven't actually given this enough thought. \\n > Even if your   immediate response   to double-trouble in turn 1 is to play friends to one of the troublemakers to try and get rid of it, you are looking at a 50/50 chance of removing   one   of two, and even if you're successful in removing both on your first attempt, it has cost you three cards (which, I will reiterate, are random and leave the viability of your deck in the hands of fate) and a bare minimum of 4 AP (and most likely 6+ AP). \\n In short,  if you are the second player , you are at a  fundamental, tangible, and measurable disadvantage  if the first player opens with a double yellow parasprite, and with the existing cards in the game there is LITERALLY nothing you can do to prevent it.  In the MOST OPTIMAL scenario, you can break even and still be a turn behind, and that's a literal gamble, as you can still lose the face-offs and the odds aren't even really in your favor. \\n The argument that you can spend AP to draw cards if you need to completely ignores the fact that AP is a limited resources (with insanely high value in the early game) and your opponent still only spent 2 AP to play both of those cards.  In truth, that you suggest the solution is to 'spend AP' against an opening that puts you at a  card AND AP  disadvantage shows you lack the understanding of just how much damage a double-parasprite opening does. \\n \\n In the case of the first player opening with two Yellow Parasprites, let's look at some scenarios. \\n FACT:  Without the use of villains, it takes a minimum of 1 turn and 2 AP to confront both parasprites. \\n \\n Minimize Damage Response:  Taking on both parasprites at the first opportunity \\n This is, theoretically, the strongest counter-response if you succeed.  More than anything, it is very important to understand the ramifications of this approach because it costs the receiving player the LEAST amount of harm. \\n The  best  scenario for doing this is to play 1 Flitter (if you're main Dash, you can also play Pegasus Royal Guard) to each problem, and then win TWO faceoffs at a -2 flip disadvantage on your second turn.  (If you're playing Blue/Pink with Dash main you can use Solar Wind to get an extra one power at ONE of the problems while still getting 2 Flitters in play, but that chance is extremely small as it requires yet another card in your deck AND hand.) If you cannot play Flitter or Pegasus Royal Guard to BOTH problems, you're at a -3 flip disadvantage.  If either faceoff fails, you're at a disadvantage.  If both faceoffs fail, you're at a SEVERE disadvantage. \\n FACT:  Even if you succeed in the above 'perfect' counter, you are at the following disadvantages \\n \\n You have been forced to play two (or three, in the Solar Wind case) specific cards instead of working to flip your mane - at least one of those plays will be suboptimal to that end.  This cost you 2 AP, 1 of which might be salvageable because you were lucky enough to win the faceoffs. \\n You have been forced to discard two cards before you even get a chance to beat the Parasprites, which is either playing at a 2 card disadvantage or a further 2 AP disadvantage to draw back up. \\n Your characters are now facing two separate problems (suboptimal), and moving those characters to fix that split costs 2 AP and you're moving 1 power characters (suboptimal). \\n \\n Meanwhile, the only benefit you can reap is 2 points that give your opponent  another  1 AP advantage on their turn.   You should probably be playing the lottery instead if you actually got away with this. \\n \\n Sequential Response:  Taking on the parasprites one at a time \\n Theoretical Best scenario:  Three Solar Wind + 1 Pegasus Royal Guard or Flitter to get 5 power to one problem.  This isn't going to happen. \\nActual Best Scenario:  2 Flitter and/or Pegasus Royal Guard to one problem. \\n In both cases, depending on what your opponent did this turn (Hint:  Anyone but Twi and AJ who has a decent hand just flipped their main and scored two points), you might have three AP.  This 3 AP MIGHT allow you to get an optimal confront off on the OTHER Parasprite for the next turn, but this inherently kills any possibility of confronting a problem this turn (and thus you won't be flipping your mane until next turn at minimum. \\n \\n Advantage over the above scenario:  Far more reliable, as you're not facing off at a disadvantage.  You're still facing off evenly, however, so there's still a hefty chance of failure. \\n \\n Disadvantage over the above scenario: You're down one more card (or one more AP if you opt to draw for that card, and at least one turn behind on flipping your mane in the vast majority of cases, not to mention you're 1 VP behind. \\n \\n \\n FACT:  While this response is more realistically possible, you're still a slave to a chance on the faceoff for it to succeed.

Currently auto-cannons are where they need to be in my opinion (except the AC2 nerf which I am still mad about TBH).  You show, quite correctly, that ballistic dps is a lower drop off rate than energy weapons.  Where we disagree is whether or not this is a good thing.  I argue that nerfing the remaining AC weapons is a mistake because that extra damage trade off comes because it balances out with ammo consumption.  If the ballistics suffer from slower projectile speed, high reload times, and the same range effects as the laser weaponry where are their advantages?  Energy weapons continue to enjoy the benefit of no ammo consumption while ballistics are gutted again to make them disproportionately weak.  I really don\\'t understand the obsession with auto-cannons and nerfing anything except PPCs. The one common denominator weapon in every single jump snipe and or meta build is the PPC yet by nerfing the AC, still having broken SRMs, and the excess ghost heat on LLs and LPLs you severely limit the viable alternatives. I\\'ve been a PP and Clan purchaser but I feel like we\\'re just going farther down this road of the PPC master race. Disappointed to say the least. \\n EDIT: Condensed replies \\n I\\'ll agree with you on the LL/ERLL as I think they are in a bad place as a weapon.

Why would a shotgun type weapon then have better damage than a rifle type weapon. \\n Next heat, some ACs suffer from high heat penalties, some do not. It\\'s hard to argue that the entire class of weapons deserves the nerf when heat is not uniformly applied in the weapons. If AC2s had the same heat to dps as a AC20 then I could live with it, but each one has a different ratio of heat generation.

So then, if we are to accept that all these ballistics are universally pinpoin (which is partially true due to splash damage) we would still not want to apply the same range restrictions to them. AC2s suffer disproportionally to this nerf compared to all other ballistic types. This is due to their faster firing rate and the fact that they are the only ballistic greatly effected by GH. AC2s have the perfect combination of low range, low damage, higher than normal heat and now a slower recycle time to see their viability drop substantially and given that the meta was never \"OMG PGI AC2S PLS NERF\" I do not understand the logic of changing it. It is simply a fact that these weapons are not heat neutral. The highest heat efficient ballistic, AC5s, are used most often when paired with PPCs.

I haven\\'t looked back since, just because its a totally different experience. I was no MLG gamer, but I think I\\'ll take a shot at answering :P \\n \\n I think to change CoD to be more competitive, you\\'d have to lay down straight rules with simple approaches. The reason that Counter-Strike has a fairly large competitive scene is its reliance on straight skill. This means removal of \\n \\n Killstreaks: I understand, it takes some skill to get there, but after that its not much. \\n \\n Gun strengths and weaknesses : In most games, it seems like one gun during the meta is  THE  gun to use, and thats pretty much it. In Counter-Strike, pretty much every gun has a strength and weakness, used for different scenarios. \\n \\n Balanced/Even maps and spawns: The spawns and map balances in CS are usually lots better than CoD, and each area affects the game. \\n \\n At the moment, it seems like both CS and CoD have pretty similar selections for their competitive games: The best of the best (Correct me if I\\'m wrong) are playing. However, Counter-Strike really relies on who has been playing longer, while in these yearly CoD\\'s, you can quickly learn in one game, then have to change in the next, possibly. I think this comes down to just sticking with less games per year. \\n \\n \"Look at what you\\'ve done.\" As Tripwire Interactive\\'s CEO has said, \"Call of Duty has almost ruined a generation of shooters\". I think CoD has pretty amazing potential, but now every game isn\\'t really sold for an update or better ideas, but just for the money. The $15 dollar DLC\\'s are outrageous, let alone $60 every year for a slightly changed game at times. \\n \\n I would definitely NOT pay $200 a year for the community change. Yes, the CoD community needs a MAJOR change, but I don\\'t play enough in the first place for $200 a year. \\n \\n Unfortunately, yes. I can see that by releasing new games, you can say the skill is always changing and growing, but it makes it so hard to get into the game. For myself, I used to seem to get the game down after a few months, and then POOF, here comes the next CoD game, along with all of the players of the other flocking to it. \\n \\n I\\'m not sure how others did it, but playing the League games and meeting people is how I got teams. This wasn\\'t the best idea, but it worked. The same can happen in any other Competitive game. \\n \\n I don\\'t think so. The reason CoD has its fame isn\\'t really for PC, its for the Consoles. It\\'s an easy way for anyone to get into a game they enjoy. Lets face it, when people say \"Yeah, I play Call of Duty on my Xbox\" or \"Yeah, I play Counter-Strike on my PC\", the latter is more likely for people to say, \"What\\'s that?\" if they aren\\'t familiar. Consoles are where CoD lives, and sure, its pretty fun on PC, but they wouldn\\'t change to only PC. \\n \\n No. Again, this comes back to console gaming. Sure, there\\'s assholes on every platform, (See the League of Legends community) and toxic players exist everywhere. But you can\\'t go very far into CoD competitive games without someone complaining about his teammate sucking so badly, or the horrible \"Your mom\" jokes being thrown around, and even the young kids screaming, \"CAN U GUIES HERE ME?\".

       " Row(content='Let\\'s step back and look at this: home buyers and renters are two different demographics. A renter MAY at some point turn into a home buyer, or they may be renters for a few reasons, two of which will make it very difficult to \"convert\" them to a different religion: \\n \\n They don\\'t want to own a home. Because when they run the numbers it just doesn\\'t make sense to them. Or because they don\\'t have time to take care of it. Or because they are getting to old to take care of it. \\n \\n They can only afford to rent. You usually qualify for a mortgage of up to 2.5 times your income. So for a $300k house, you are looking at $150k salary a year, plus $30,000+ down payment. \\n \\n They got burnt in the Great Recession. They were foreclosed on, their credit was wrecked, they have the emotional baggage to match it. \\n \\n They are saving up to own a home and will one day. Maybe they are new to the area and trying to figure out the best neighborhoods, maybe they are just starting their careers, newly weds, etc. \\n \\n \\n Your first step is to do the market research on the area you live in. What are the average renters like? What are their incomes like? What are their current costs of living like? Does it allow for them to put money back to own a home? Can they afford to own a home in your area...in a location that is as nice and safe as where they can rent one in? This is to determine if it is even worth the time to throw a bunch of money at remarketing to them or if it would just be easier to put it in a pile and set it on fire. \\n At the same time, look into other marketing targets that you can potentially tap that would give you a greater ROI. There are, see the end of this for my recommendation. \\n Ok, so you determined that it would be worth it, either their are homes available for under $300k that would work with the average renter\\'s salary, there are programs available to help or a majority of the renters are upper class and can afford to be homeowners, just aren\\'t for reasons that can be changed. \\n Develop a profile for what the renters with the best possibility of moving up to home owner: salary, demographics, interests, concerns, and most importantly: what is stopping them from pulling the trigger on a house. These are the hot leads. \\n You need to segment your lead list in order not to risk spamming people like those in group 1 who have no interest or 3 those with emotional scars from even coming back to you as rental clients. Send them emails before their lease expires is a great idea, but highlight a dozen or so new rental properties available, two or three homesales available and add a call for action RE: Interested in homeownership? Let\\'s meet for coffee and we can help answer your questions and programs available. or something along those lines. It\\'s relatively inexpensive, but don\\'t expect a large return on new homeowners from it. \\n What your broker needs to do is develop relationship building communications, not just spamming the crap out of people with marketing pieces. She needs to research/develop a CRM system plan (like salesforce) for this and train her realtors how to collect personal information during discussion, then how to quantify that \"lead\" for their potential to move from renter to homeowner. The \"hot leads\" are the ones that you focus on \"growing.\" \\n You launch a \"program\" designed to help provide information on savings resources, homeowners programs, homeownership 101. Call them to see how things are, send them welcome baskets when they first signed their lease, etc. These are the ways to form a relationship with potential buyers and help them take steps towards the ultimate goal: closing. \\n It\\'s a lot of work for not a lot of coin. Instead of trying to remarket traditional renters, you could start a marketing campaign helping potential buyers find short term rentals while they look for a house. A lot of people in our area come from up north after they sold their house and need something temporary while finding a more permanent place. You could work out deals with landlords to give them a bonus from the commission of the sale in exchange for the extra work involved catering to the temporary situation. \\n OR hold first home buyer workshops to gather leads. \\n If she really wants to remarket previous clients, she has a better chance of remarketing to current homeowners. These are the people who have collateral to their names. They also offer you two chances at commission: sell their current house, get commission. Find new home: get commission. \\n She could also hold workshops on investment properties and gain leads this way.', summary='lots of better ways to invest the marketing funds into a target market that actually has the collateral to play the realty game.

       " Row(content='I\\'ll start with a side note) This is the reason why some melee players shun from this game, the reason why they feel it\\'s \"off\". As much as Melee itself is not exempt from such \"gimmicks\" (see: Shiek\\'s dthrow), such really good, almost free moves, are possessed by a good deal of the cast. Such things may be offset from other inherent character disadvantages, but that doesn\\'t remove that they\\'re  there  and it doesn\\'t make them feel any less cheap when they happen. \\n Now , I\\'m not saying they\\'re completely in the right with that, because Melee has a number of such really good moves, but what we did at the time was just learn to deal with it. We learned to DI every time Jiggs throws up, try to never get grabbed from Sheik, beware of Fox\\'s shine etc. \\n The fact is that those very moves  were  nerfed by the PMDT, which means they  are  actively interested in delivering a \"not OP\" feel to the characters. So where did it go wrong with the \"newcomers\"? \\n Well, first there\\'s to understand that the so-called meta is something really complicated to grasp, especially since it\\'s really matchup-based, and not character-based, and doubly so when there\\'s  so many fucking characters . The PMDT couldn\\'t and shouldn\\'t be expected to know how a meta would evolve in any number of following months, as they\\'re only a handful of testers and we\\'re an entire community, with multiple tourneys each week. \\n To further elaborate how fragile a meta is, keep in mind that a spot in the tier list depends for the most part on how you fare against the top of the food chain (ie.  how tourney-viable are you ). In Melee, many characters would actually be pretty good, if only someone couldn\\'t just pull out a Shiek and chaingrab them to death, or pull out a Fox and waveshine them till offstage or usmash them with extreme prejudice, etc. \\n To drive this point home, look at what happened to Jiggs. Next to no change from Melee (the biggest is a laggier upthrow, so no spacie massacre) and suddenly bottom tier. This shows that as much as a fighter can find even ground in many matchups (see: veterans), just a number of bad matchups can ruin your day, week, year, everything. \\n Then there\\'s the fact that sometimes a character may take its sweet time to come into the light and fully bloom, like it happened for Jiggs in Melee. This underdog factor ofc only complicates things, as they are events that greatly upset balance and meta when they happen. \\n Then even discounting all that, for how much you test a fighter among your couple dozen testers, there\\'s not much telling what will happen to his combat flow in a year\\'s time or more, not even backing ourselves with Melee foreknowledge. As much faster now as it was then, the fact is, meta development still takes time, and  any time is still too much time  if you want to see the results in the alpha stages, when the game\\'s not out yet. \\n So, given that the less obvious ways for a character to be made good are out of the discussion when in dev phase, the only remaining possibility is, use the more obvious ways.  Think of a possible flow you\\'d want this character to express and build the moves around it.  The alternative would be buffing and nerfing  without  a precise idea of where you want to lead this char\\'s meta towards, but that easily looks even worse to me. This inevitably leads to unsubtle moves in terms of power and possible use. \\n It\\'s easy to then understand that in the first stages (read: first years) the meta may feel clunky, because it was basically spoonfed to us by the PMDT, and not shaped by organically exploring every nook and cranny of the fighters\\'s possibilities, doubly so when one realizes there\\'s like four times the matchups to explore and a goddamn lot more options available to the player, with basically all of the ATs from Melee AND Brawl COMBINED at the character\\'s disposal, plus optionally MORE (like Squirtle). \\n But, given that the characters can be edited at any time, this is what I actually feel is the best policy. It makes for a lot of viable characters from the get go (instead of the veterans dominating until by stroke of luck someone discovers how to actually play X decently) and when things get out of hand, you can always rein it in by careful application of the nerf stick. In time, each character may feel organic and realized in this manner.', summary=\"It is my belief that, to the degree that stuff couldn't be foreseen, they intended to make the newcomers about on par with the veterans, compensating with stronger moves for their underdeveloped meta, and then as the meta catches up, nerf whatever sticks out as not fun.\", author='Tosxychor', subreddit='SSBPM', tickers=['META'], sentiment=0.0),\n",

He doesn\\'t break the game the same way Lilly did to Maxwell on her release. He sure as hell isn\\'t going to be meta for Raids either. \\n The meta is either Maxwell or BC+Mitigation. Nobody cares about flat boosting LS outside of Arena. Before Zebra+BC Gen meta, people actually used to use a slew of different squad compositions that ranged from mono to rainbow to sparks and occasionally critical before Michele\\'s 6  tier. Now everything is cookie cutter with Lilly+Mitigation or just mitigation or Maxwell. So fun. How is it in that the 6 months that Maxwell has been out on the Japan server that Alim has not been able to either invent a new mechanic or LS or unit that can be used as a worthy unit as opposed to Maxwell in everything that is questing and FH? I don\\'t envy JP end game players because I know what squads they\\'ve been using for the last six months and holy shit global players were bored after 2 months of Maxwell so I wonder how those people feel. They probably just use the 7  starters just to fuck around because their LS are less than impressive, and I don\\'t see a comeback for mono squads but hey this can change right? \\n \\n Every single batch of RS units that Japan releases is a \"cash grab\" no different from Global\\'s release. Do you think that you\\'ll need any of the units from Rosetta\\'s batch?

Rosetta\\'s entire batch have LSs that aren\\'t going to be used over Maxwell or BC generation and conversion isn\\'t a new buff that was invented in the Dragonslayer\\'s batch either. This mechanic has been around from Bahvel the farmable unit which was reintroduced and added to RS units in the Dragonslayer\\'s batch, but ultimately doesn\\'t do anything regarding the meta game other than add a bit of extra damage. It just seems to me that since the Zelnite\\'s batch that all the units that Alim\\'s developed thus far have literally been cash grabs that slowly accentuate the power creep of units from before without actually trying to create new variants around the current meta game that is Maxwell-centric. \\n So why is it that when Gumi actually invents something that is different and new to the game that you people give it flak? Taunt can be surprisingly useful if used in conjunction with mitigation and the new shield buff can be used effectively as well. Being OP or not OP isn\\'t the question at hand when Alim develops Maxwell and does nothing in the last six months to change the meta and not only that but buffs the unit\\'s DC to 66 as if she wasn\\'t already good enough. \\n All of you fanboys of Alim have been constantly arguing about there being  more  content for you to tackle, but as an end game player the fact that even if Gumi were to release all the content that Japan has right now and ship it over to Global I would beat the entirety of it within a few hours, and so would many end game players, makes it unexciting. Stop living in the facade of thinking that this constant release of content that is no different from the variations of content that already exist is supposedly \"fun\". If anything I enjoyed doing Trial of the Gods that Gumi released from 1-6 more than the Maxwell Trial because it brought new mechanics that have never been seen before in the game. It also prompted usage of the most overlooked buff in the game DEF ignore and many people appreciated these series of dungeons as a fun and puzzling challenge that was different from the mindless Maxwell spamming. \\n If you\\'re a high level P2P player that\\'s already hit end game then it\\'s pretty easy to realize that this new content impending is going to be the same thing unless they create ways to dampen the effect that Maxwell has right now on the meta. When Trial 4 comes out I won\\'t rejoice because I\\'ll beat Cardes in less than 5 turns because my trusty waifu Maxwell exists. Thank you Alim for based balancing. Perhaps with Trial 5 and incoming GQ (Grah\\'s) things to come will be more exciting because God forbid if Alim implemented some of the mechanics like Taunt, LS removal (Lico from ToTG), or anything else to make things less stale because Gumi developed it. \\n Here\\'s my salt that I transferred from another post I made.

A TRUE all class melee weapon (meaning unlike ALL other all class weapons, it can be used by the spy and engineer who normally never get to use all class weapons). Aside from being a true all class melee weapon, it has a special ability only one other true all class melee weapon has and that ability is to turn the people you melee to death with it into lifeless, semi-motionless statues of solid gold. This is, AGAIN, purely cosmetic. This is why the weapon is so expensive. The odds of earning one from playing mann versus machine mode are even lower than unboxing an unusual hat. Odds are 0.06% last I checked... I mentioned another weapon that does the same thing as the G.F.P. and is also a true all class melee weapon and that weapon is the Saxxy.  A small golden statuette of one of the games characters, Saxton Hale.

I didn\\'t really play multiplayer shooters before TF2. I loved the class updates, and still appreciate Valve\\'s dedication to the game even though my own interest in it has dwindled. It hasn\\'t been one thing, that I can point to and say \"that\\'s why I don\\'t play TF2 any more.\" TF2\\'s evolution has been gradual. This information shouldn\\'t be taken as a rant, per se, or an argument of objective truth. These are merely my subjective perceptions of how the game has changed and why that has caused me to lose interest in it. Tons of people still play TF2 all the time and enjoy every minute of it, and that\\'s great. \\n Item Drops:  I think item drops were the beginning of the end for me. I understand why they did it, and even agree with their reasoning, but it has never really felt like a good change to the meta game to me. The easier crafting options for new items later on mitigated this though. \\n Trading:  I was excited about the introduction of trading, since the drop system was so tedious, but trading has ultimately left a bad taste in my mouth. I know, if you don\\'t like it don\\'t use it. For the most part, I don\\'t. I have never traded with anyone outside my friends list. I\\'m a casual player; I didn\\'t spend a lot of time playing TF2 after about the 2nd year, and didn\\'t feel like waiting for drops and making trades was a good use of my limited play time. \\n Unlock Variety:  There was a brief period of time in which I had every unlock in the game. That can never happen again. For quite a while after that, I was able to at least keep up with everything that had been added to the game. By the end of 2010, I couldn\\'t even do that any more. Ok, that\\'s fine, I don\\'t need to be the ultimate TF2 expert. But this has in-game consequences as well. I can no longer recognize at a glance what my opponents are wielding, and even if I could, the number of loadout permutations across an entire team is now so high that my ability to assess and respond to threats appropriately is significantly diminished. This leads combat to feel more random and less fun. \\n Visual Style:  I won\\'t say much about this except that the visual style of TF2 is much less cohesive than it used to be, partially due to the unlocks but mainly due to hats. This doesn\\'t bother me a lot, but it bothers me a little. \\n Crafting:  Not a fan, but it\\'s not a big deal. \\n MannCo:  I actually have no problem with this. Valve is more than deserving of some additional revenue in return for the years of entertainment TF2 has provided. \\n Overall, I just don\\'t get the same enjoyment out of the game any more. I\\'m a solid player; when I do periodically jump in, I\\'m consistently a top scorer. Even with the increased randomness, the game is clearly still heavily team- and skill-based. Valve hasn\\'t ruined TF2. They\\'ve just guided its evolution into something new and different. I like some of those changes. I dislike others.

Much of this is simply due to lack of knowledge about scripture and translations. \\n The greek word arsenokoitai, which is used in 1 corinithians 6:9-10 and 1 Timothy 1:9-10, is what christians try to translate to our modern day word of \"homosexual\". Our use and definition of this word in this day and age, would not have been the same a couple of thousand years ago. The greek word arsenokoitai is a word actually coined by Paul, hence it can only be found in the above listed passages. This word is first seen in the 1 Corinithians passage. Upon starting to read through this chapter (and the relevant verses at hand), references would already have been noticed by the reader toward mosaic law, especially jews back in that who knew mosaic law very well. The fact that Paul doesnt give any definition of this word, arsenokoitai, seems to indicate that it was something already known to the audience. This leads us back to Leviticus. \\n Leviticus 18:22 says, \"\\'Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.\" (NIV) \\n Or in the greek, \"kai meta arsenos ou koimēthēsē koitēn gunaikos bdelugma gar estin\" (Greek OT Septuagint) \\n Levitcus 20:13 says, \"If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable.

This word and meaning need not be defined because it related to a sin that the readers/audience were already aware of. These passages of Leviticus are referring to Levitical Holiness Codes. These were standards that priests in the temples were held to and there is a whole barrage of them. The specific one in question , however, is refering to shrine prostitution. Use of the words to mean shrine prostitution was common and can be seen in various writings from the first century. To further delve into this you can look at the added context in these two verses from Leviticus. It mentions, in both, to not lie with man LIKE ONE LIES WITH A WOMAN. The socio-cultural status of women at the time was very low. Women were seen as property and as that of somebody in a lower position. Talking about men in this context would mean that one man would have higher standing as compared to the other man (the one considered lower). This further gives insight into seeing that these verses are talking about shrine prostitution (and possibly rape or use of you boys). \\n Just on this initial glance, you can start to see that the bible is not condemning a loving, committed gay relationship.', summary='There is no real biblical backing for condemning committed, homosexual relationships.', author='jekessle', subreddit='atheism', tickers=['META'], sentiment=0.0),\n",

No. And GW2, untill now, was never sparking anyone's radar for 'special'. \\n The issue everyone sees with the MMO genre is this: It's boring.

If he had STOPPED and turned around when he saw his and Zoe's past selves, he maybe could have stayed with the town and the people he loved.  But now he can't, because he decided he'd deal with it tomorrow.  But tomorrow, Carter's going to discover that the world is not as he thinks, and he can never go home again. \\n Because Eureka is Brigadoon.  Crazy theory ahead: \\n Let's face it, the whole show is fantastic science fiction.  The problems they solve and the solutions they have available are unrealistic.  It is a world that exists in itself, and it plays by its own rules.  This world has contact with its own version of the outside world, which is why they can go to nearby towns and to the airport and Fargo can go do guest spots on Warehouse 13.  But this is not the real outside world.  The show is episodic, which means that the world in which they live is a series of problems that arise and EVERYONE deals with them.  Literally the entire town is affected almost every time something goes wrong.  Their entire world centers around up to four things at a time that all get wrapped up at the same time in one week, plus one thing that takes a year.  The point is that the town itself (and outlying areas) works along powerful storyline structures.  So when a story gets sufficiently complicated, and then resolved, the entire world shifts.  This explains why events like Alison's first wedding and the subsequent death of Nathan Stark are prone to time/space related problems; the very fabric of Eureka morphs when something so dramatic occurs.  1947 and the new timeline.  The Matrix in particular is pretty amazing: the Astraeus launch was so cool, it created its new timeline INSIDE ITSELF.  So when something as important as the shutdown and reinstating of Eureka as a whole occurs, when you get an episode that is cheesier-than-normal moment after damn-that's-a-lot-of-cheese moment, the world of Eureka can morph again.  And let's face it, Carter's story is basically done.  In terms of his growth as a character, in terms of the growth of his family, in terms of Zoe and her personal journey, everything has come up roses for Carter.  His story-arc is complete.  He learned how to be a good father to Zoe, Zoe turned into a stretching-plausibility success, and he got to try again at the art of finding love, raising a family, even getting a new child on the way with this new family.  Yes, everything is pretty much wrapped up. \\n Which is why they're never coming back.  Carter and Zoe are now locked outside of Eureka.  They emerge, 5 years later, at the exact place in time and space where they entered.  Eureka has finished with them.  The storyline that includes Carter is over, because it has reached its perfection.  Everyone got what they wanted and needed, and any new incarnation of Eureka will have to be sufficiently different that it has room to grow.  Or, more likely, since we can expect to never hear or see anything more from Eureka, perhaps it was a chance universe that existed for such a short moment in time that our characters overlapped themselves in four-dimensions (or something, blah, blah, science jargon, meta-symmetry, blah).  The point here is that Carter and Zoe passed through this universe and came out going the other way, 5 years older, but having not moved through normal spacetime.  So all of it never really happened.  Two timelines, both contained in one separate universe, connected to our universe by a wormhole, culminating in the completion of Jack's story and the  showing to him of that story via wormholes  as he travels backwards through the story to reach a point which, because of quantum, is both beginning and end:  his return to reality.  And now he and Zoe are back in 2006, 5 years older than when they entered with no explanation for it, driving a vehicle which may or may not be the most scientifically advanced piece of machinery on planet Earth, and intimate knowledge of innumerable devices, forces, formulas, scenarios, all sorts of stuff.  Everything that Eureka taught them, they know, and it's even feasible that out of everything they learned (Zoe went to Eureka-verse Harvard), one or two things are even possible.  I see them hunted by the military who want to dissect their memories, torn apart by grief for the world they lost, snatched from their grasp at the very moment it attained perfection, haunted by memories of loved ones' faces, of places that never existed, bonds that were never real.  But they were real, in that other space, and so they study as they run, using their advanced knowledge and their understanding of how the Eureka-verse operates, hoping they can build something.

Okay, BS meta-argument out of the way. \\n I wish to address your distinction between fundamentalists and moderates because it isn\\'t exactly a clearly defined line. I would actually argue that there is no such thing as a practicing moderate (as the two terms are mutually exclusive) but that is not central to what should be the discussion. \\nThe importance of allegory and metaphor when interpreting religious texts is absolutely vital to the continued relevance of religion at large. As you state, \"...it is because people are being disenfranchised and forgotten\". As people cling to ancient doctrines in an era where they are not just less relevant but actually counterproductive, the ideas and the people who hold them close will become disenfranchised and forgotten. It is by their own resistance to change that they become marginalized.  However, your next statement falls short of the mark: it is not the language of the educated that fails them, nor is it any other feature of educated society; they are being failed by their own beliefs, their clinging to magic in an era where electricity is controlled with the flick of a finger. They are failing  themselves  by refusing to accept the education. \\n This leads me to the presence of moderate religious such as yourself. There\\'s an acceptance of the education and the presence of knowledge, and it supplants a more literal interpretation with a figurative one - one that, by necessity, is more pliable and less definitive. This interpretation accepts that snakes don\\'t talk and the sun can\\'t stand still; it replaces concrete histories of global flooding and solar fixation and replaces them with malleable allegories of sin and salvation, of obedience and grace. This is the approach Paul took with his epistles, and is a \"sensible\" approach today within a religious context. \\nHowever, this sidesteps a big problem. It leaves an elephant in the room, as it were. Even allowing that the earth wasn\\'t  really  flooded, or it wasn\\'t  actually  a talking snake, these stories carry with them a core tenet - a fundamental idea that is an absolute necessity to the religious dogma. This tenet, when removed from the equation of sin and salvation, makes the entire story of Jesus meaningless and renders the whole of the New Testament unusable. This tenet is that of \"original sin\". Eve\\'s transgression led to the entire human race (and some would say the whole world) to be corrupted - without this original sin there is no necessity for Jesus\\' sacrifice, or mandated atonement at all. If the world  wasn\\'t  corrupted by a man, then there is no need for redemption of the world through a man.

Not much to say, it just didn't work, it's a champion with a burst, no tons of ability will only lead to no burst. Yes, you will be versatile though and survive for more time, thus dealing more damage with your Q and W on cd, but it wouldn't work that way, you can't trust Q and W for sustain damage, esp with no ap heavy items and w/o your death upgrade. There are champions that are just better at being tanky APs, have way more sustained damage and are way beefier, like Vlad/Rumble/Ryze, everyone one of 'em unique on his role, but all of 'em stronger at everything compared to Viktor. \\n \\n Mid/Late game: \\n \\n Imho, the only route/build that felt viable, has not a lot of item choices, which is also against the meta of the game (tunnel vision item building/deciding your build w/o counting on the state of the game). What I do when I play him is ignore E at early levels (incredibely risky), buy a couple of dorans, when I feel I have enough AP for Death upgrade to scale well with, buying this one as well, and in the meantime building a cap. By the time you have these 2-3 doran's, Death upgrade, and deathcap, you have more than 400 AP if i recall correctly, that's around the 20min mark of the game assuming that the risky part of the route went well and you're not behind, at this point of the game, you're POWERFUL, this is your all in, this where I start roaming whenever I have a cooldown on my ulti, you can even gank behind towers since you can literally one-shot everything, sometimes you won't even bother taking more than one tower-shot. Later in the game I proceed building accordingly, I guess with the current state of the League, I'd get a DFG eventually and a Void Staff ofc. \\n But after that, it feels like the champion scales down, the fact that in teamfights, you can't throw your burst in the backline, and the fact that it won't do much to a beefy frontline, renders the champion not viable. You'll find yourself holding your burst for a long time just because you have nothing to throw it at, the range feels shorter and shorter as the game goes on and on, you'll end up bursting tanks to 50%, and keeping some low sustained damage, that relies on a short range, coming from a squishy champion. Instead, Ahris will be dealing sustained damage to the teamfight, while having the option to safely burst a squishy target, Ryzes will be shredding those tanks with his endless sustained damage and good burst, Orianas, will make a huge impact on the teamfight with their endless sustained damage and huge utility, it feels like every other AP has just something better to give there. \\n \\n Sorry for the long and messy post, I'll try to clean it up after I post it, feel free to correct any of my mistakes, I'm not used to post in Reddit, I'm usually just lurking =).\", summary=\"Viktor is a strong mid game champion, his kit though denies him a solid early and late game and sometimes even mid game won't get that well, you won't always be winning these mids.\", author='Mirmigis', subreddit='LeagueofLegendsMeta', tickers=['META'], sentiment=0.0026525198481976986),\n",

       " Row(content=\"Okay, this is kind of something I specialize in. I am a Gold 3 support main, but I LOVE to try out all champions to see what they can provide in the support role. In my experience I have come up with a few unusual supports that I have come to love. My top 3 are Vladimir, Yorick and Jinx support. I also like Elise, Nidalee and Annie support but those are actually kind of meta. \\n Here is what I build on each one and what they provide for laning phase and for the team. \\n Vladimir \\n Build:  Start the game with Relic shield, a ward, a health pot and the ward totem (His Q is perfect for last hitting and procing the Shield procs, he scales well off of HP and he can use Face of the Mountain very effectively later in the game). Your early core involves boots, targons and a sightstone. \\n Your final build should normally include defensive boots or sorc boots,Ruby sightstone, Spirit Visage, Randuins, Liandry's and Face of the Mountain. If you do not want to build as tanky as I do you can replace some of the tank items with Zhonyas, WOTA, D-Cap, Abyssal and DFG. \\n Lane:  Vlad has powerful lane presence and can poke for a lot of damage very safely. He does this because his Q heals him, canceling out a lot of retaliation poke, and his W is perfect if the opposing Blitz or Leona decide to try to do something about your harass. If you play it right and Q the ADC and Support constantly you can zone the opposing lane extremely hard. \\n Team:  To the team, you are either bringing in another Bruiser/Tank or another APC. He has medium to high damage at all stages of the game that the opponent cannot do much about because he sustains so well and has an excellent escape mechanic. His ult is perfect for most team comps, as it is an AOE ability that increases damage done to the target from ALL sources by 12%. \\n Yorick \\n Build:  Like Vlad, you start the game with Relic shield, a ward, a health pot and the ward totem. Early you get a tear, boots, targons and a sightstone. From there you want to get your frozen fist ASAP, getting either sheen or glacial shroud first depending on what is needed. \\n On Yorick, your full build should be defensive boots, Muramana, Frozen Fist, Face of the Mountain, Ruby sightstone and the last item being a tank item (such as Randuins, Frozen heart or Spirit Visage). \\n Lane:  In lane you max W or E (W for larger slow and longer range harass, E for sustain). What your job is as Yorick support is to constantly harass the enemy ADC and Support and zone them from CS, much like Vlad. Once you get your Tear of the Goddess this becomes much easier to do. Yorick has innate tankiness from his passive and sustain from his E, so he can afford to stand in the bush spamming ghouls while getting autoed every once in a while. \\n Team:  Yorick brings a massive tank with decent base damages and slows to the team, as well as his ult, which allows a carry on your team to have a second chance in a teamfight. When used on the right champion at the right time, Yorick's ult can turn around games. I have turned many losing teamfights into aces for my team by ulting the ADC or APC. The Muramana and Frozen Fist allow Yorick to be a very powerful force, capable of dueling very well while being extremely resilient. One last thing Yorick brings to his team is very safe Barons or Dragons. His ghouls and his ult can be used to tank for a long time. \\n Jinx \\n Build:  Jinx's start as a support is interesting as none of the items specifically cater to her. I like to start with an Ancient Coin, a health pot, a ward and the ward totem. Your early core is boots, Tear, Nomad's Medallion and sightstone. Get a vamp scepter and brutalizer as soon as possible after. \\n Jinx's final build should include CDR boots, Muramana, Ruby SightStone, Black Cleaver and BT. You can sell the nomads medallion or upgrade it, that is your call. Otherwise you can finish your build with IE. \\n Lane:  As Jinx, you max W first, Q second and E last. What this means in lane is you have a low CD W that has high base damage at higher ranks and a massive slow. You can think of yourself as an AD version of AP Nidalee Support, but with lots of CC. Your job in lane is to poke the enemy ADC and Support constantly, and use your E to catch anyone who overextends or anyone ganking you. The free attack speed on her Q leads to a lot of extra tower damage, and the additional range on her Q means safer auto harass. \\n Team:  Jinx becomes somewhat of a second ADC for her team, but builds a bit more like a supportive AD caster. You have a massive slow and a very easy to land snare. Your ultimate has very high base damage and scaling, and can be used to help other lanes (you can single handedly win someone else's lane with a well aimed ult). During teamfights your job is to constantly lane Ws and use your CC to either peel or catch people out. High ranks in her Q lead to excessively fast turret killing. High ranks in her Q also lead to constant auto poking alongside her W. Overall Jinx Support provides for her team a secondary ADC that has a decent amount of utility and CC. \\n Sorry for the novel, but you posted something that I know a lot about and enjoy experimenting with so I thought I would share my results with you.\", summary='Try out support Vlad, Yorick and Jinx.', author='DieSchmerzen', subreddit='summonerschool', tickers=['META'], sentiment=0.0),\n",

       " Row(content=\"What those who defend competitive say is basically this when they defend the meta of a few classes being far better: \\n > A well developed meta has been created over time that establishes these classes... you can't beat the capabilities of these classes \\n See the thing is, if the stars had aligned in 2008 at the inception of 6s, and valve supported it, and valve made its updates  for  6s and not for pubs, and the 6s community didn't need to ban things because valve was balancing stuff for it anyway - meaning no dumb shit that is just for pubs such as new short circuit, pomson, etc. \\n Now ok we have that scenario in mind. \\n Valve's design philosophy was to balance skill floors - meaning balancing pubs. That means that, to players that have anywhere between 4 and 400 hours (what pubs will have), the game is balanced well between the 9 classes. In a pub, a decent engineer is just as good as a decent soldier. A decent spy is just as good as a decent scout. A decent pyro is just as good as a decent demoman.  Its clear that valve's goal with balancing was to achieve this equilibrium with the 9 classes.  Valve has balanced the game to skill floors. \\n But in doing so they have chosen not to care about balancing the skill ceilings.  The skill floors are balanced, the skill ceilings are not . Clarification of what I mean by balanced is the 9 classes are more or less all useful at different times, but they are all useful, like it is in pubs with low-mid-good players, with very few people if anyone at the skill ceilings. So skill ceilings are unbalanced, so that means  in any competitive format that would develop, the classes will be unbalanced because the skill ceilings are unbalanced. \\n Meaning that demoman, 90% of the time is a faaar better choice than pyro, 9% of the time a somewhat better choice, and 1% pyro is better. Say what you will about generalists and specialists, you can't deny that the gulf between demo and pyro, as an example, is just ridiculous. Pyros are only useful defending last on uber disadvantage, to suicide against an enemy uber and waste it. \\n Now let's go back to that scenario I drew up.  What if valve had decided to balance for competitive: to the skill ceilings, not the floors?  Now since we know that valve, through their balancing, would want to create an equilibrium of the 9 classes (as they have done on the skill floors, which they have been balancing for while ignoring the ceilings).  If Valve had focused on the game at the skill ceiling; and balanced the game for that skill ceiling as they have done for the skill floors (because their focus has been on the floors); then, the same thing that has happened at the skill floors would have happened at the skill ceiling: That being an equilibrium of all 9 classes in which they are all fairly equal overall. And that means that competitive, at the skill ceiling, had valve focused on it, would have 9 fairly equal classes. \\n If Valve focused on competitive and balanced for competitive from the beginning, many of normal tf2 players issues with competitive would have been gone, for example competitive would have 9 balanced classes. That meta with some classes being better than others would never have happened because that goes against what valve wants.\", summary=\"Look at the above bolded part. \\n There are things Valve could have done since 2007 or 2008 in order to balance the game to the skill ceilings. For example spy loses a lot of effectiveness at the skill ceiling because of comms. Maybe more convincing disguises, maybe the ability to sow confusion in enemy ranks somehow. in order to be mess up focused players. Pyro is bad because of his short range and limited mobility. Solve one of those problems and pyro is much better at the skill ceiling (might be a bit more difficult so that it doesn't overlap too much with soldier and stuff but I digress). Demoman is too good because he often can set up defensive perimeters more quickly than players can get into close range: while with skill ceiling level pipe aim, his close range weakness is greatly improved. Plus he has ridiculous mobility in certain situations with the sticky jump (not nearly as reliable as the rocket jump, but ridiculously good in situations like rollouts and when medics are smart). A lot of these things aren't nearly nearly as big of a deal at the skill floors but at the skill ceiling they conspire to make demo incredibly powerful. These could probably be rectified some way or maybe other classes would just get ways to counter it. \\n Now, all of this is saying nothing to whether valve would even want competitive to take off, as another comment talked about how valve wants to focus on csgo and dota.

Also watching League streamers you may pick up an idea of what is what. \\n I would say that once you get comfortable with how League feels(Seeing as you're a Dota2 veteran it should come pretty naturally or very quick to you) stick to 1 role whether it be  top, mid, adc(now called marksman..), support or jungle . \\n The roles depend on your playstyle. \\n Top is usually the place where tanky champions are used with some exceptions such as Riven or Tryndamere(Just 2 examples of champions who go top who aren't tanky/build tanky). I'd suggest watching some top laner streams like; Dyrus and Boxbox(Flosd), Boxbox only plays Riven top. Dyrus would be the more current-meta picks. \\n Mid is usually where either  assassins  or  mages  go. These build  Ability Power  which, in the name, makes their  Abilities  stronger. There are some exceptions such as the champion called  Zed  who you would build  Attack Damage  on. Some champions abilities scale differently, like Zed, they scale with attack damage instead of ability power. \\n ADC(or Marksman) are very squishy champions but can deal out a lot of sustained damage, they are all reliant on Attack Damage. With the exception of a couple who also deal out a fair amount of Magic Damage but you still build Attack Damage on them. If you're not familiar with what squishy means (I have never played Dota 2 so I don't know what terms you use) it just means that they can be killed very easily as they do not have much defensive stats such as; Armor and Magic Resist. Squishy also falls under a lot of  Mid  champions too. \\n Supports are what help  peel (Keep people off of the ADC so that the ADC can deal the most damage without the threat of dying) for the ADC. They are there with them in the bot lane. Supports generally do not deal much damage but their kit helps them to catch people out, let's take the champion  Thresh  as an example, Thresh's Q ability called  Death Sentence  will throw a chain and if it hits the enemy it will  bind  them(You can drag them towards you twice and they cannot move out of it) and if you activate it again you are able to fly over towards the enemy champion and then use your E ability which is called  Flay , this will push the enemy in a direction depending where your mouse is, if your mouse is closer to the bottom of your screen it will pull them towards the bottom of your screen. These type of champions kits are designed to help out the  team  with locking down enemies, peeling and being there to to basically keep their team safe. \\n I also agree with /u/xlarukux with practicing CS'ing. I'll try go a little more into detail on it as there's a bit of information that can be quite important. \\n CS'ing(Creep Score, killing the minions in lane/jungle, but we'll stick with the lane minions). \\n 1 Kill = 300 gold. So if your enemy laner kills you for their  first kill , you will only need roughly 18 CS above of them to still be  even  in lane and they will  not  be ahead of you for them killing you. \\n If you then give them a 2nd kill. Their 2nd kill will then be worth 360 gold. You will need roughly 38 CS above of them to still be even. \\n This is why CS'ing is so important, even if you're not getting kills and you're being killed. If you have a CS advantage you will not have to worry too much about giving up a kill. However, if you do have a CS advantage, you will have a gold advantage over them. Therefore with your gold advantage you will be able to buy a few items before them, which in return means it will be harder for them to kill you in the first place.

I know a lot of the negative feedback on Telltale and Bioware is related to the false choices. Why give them a choice if in the end, there\\'s no choice? Why are you writing interactive fiction if they can\\'t actually interact with it? But, yes. It\\'s MUCH easier to write a branching story that has fewer branches. This is why a lot of these types of games rely on the Angel/Devil morality scale. Overdone, but it\\'s easier to work with only two different routes of story than 20. \\n After thinking of it, I think that the issue is that Telltale and Bioware stories don\\'t really  branch  so much as  thread ...

I know in the VN community, there\\'s a bit of ranting about dating sims in particular because they want to consume story, not play around with schedules and mini games. Just think about how the two pieces fit together and whether whatever mechanics you throw in are going to put off the audience you want.) PS: If there\\'s little or no story choices, what you\\'re dealing with isn\\'t really interactive fiction, so much. \\n re: How would I do it? - I\\'d make each episode stand-alone. For example, Sake Visual\\'s Jisei/Kansei/Yousei series is more or less stand-alone, though they build upon the meta plot of the characters. Basically, just like a mystery novel series rather than, say, a mystery serial where it takes them several issues/episodes to solve the mystery. I\\'d also make the first episode  very  self-contained, so that if the response to it was lukewarm and I decided it was a better investment of my time and energy to discontinue it, I haven\\'t left readers at a point where they wouldn\\'t trust me to complete projects.

       " Row(content='If you want something to do nothing harder than play Minecraft, then you have a pretty good selection.  Anything from a mid-range notebook and upwards can do a pretty good job with vanilla minecraft, and better with optifine.  If you are on a budget you will have to either wait for sales (I got a $1300 gaming laptop for $350 a couple black Fridays ago) or go with a lower-end system.  Here is what I would suggest for a good laptop for MC: \\n With a big budget: \\n \\n Go with 8GB+ of ram, although don\\'t spend extra for more than 16. \\n Get a quad core CPU if possible, but make sure it is not one of AMD\\'s \"quad\" core setups with two doubled cores.  It\\'s really the same as a dual-core HT Intel chip, but AMD calls them quad core. \\n SSD over HDD can give you a huge performance boost, especially with single player because world loading and saving will no longer factor into the tick time.  However SSDs are often smaller than HDDs, and have a somewhat shorter life span. \\n Get a GPU with at least 1 or 2 GB of ram, but make sure it is not Integrated, Discreet, or Discreet Class.  A full GPU in a laptop is usually called \"Dedicated\", and that is better because it means the GPU has it\\'s own RAM and separate core.  What type of card you get is up to you, but if you are looking at a particular system make sure to google the card and look at it\\'s ratings. \\n \\n With a small budget: \\n \\n Get at least 6GB RAM, ideally 8GB.  If anything you can go with less and upgrade it later. \\n CPU should ideally be a dual core HT (doubled) / quad core non-HT (non-doubled) with a clock speed of at least ~2.4GH, OR a slower quad core HT / AMD 8 core chip. \\n SSDs are expensive so if possible get a caching/hybrid HDD (A hardrive with a small SSD boot partition) and if not a normal HDD will do as long as it is a decent speed (7200+ RPM is ideal).  If necessary sacrifice hard drive space and get a better CPU/GPU/RAM, because you can always upgrade the HDD later or store your files on an external drive. \\n GPU should have at least 1 GB of ram, and should be something other than Integerated.  Dedicated is ideal, but discreet/discreet class is OK as well.  If you find an otherwise amazing deal Integrated is acceptable, but make sure the system has a lot of ram because the GPU will most likely be using the main system ram (with aside from giving less ram to OS, is also much slower). \\n \\n Some general pointers: \\n \\n For Minecraft the order of performance for single player is CPU > GPU > HDD > RAM, for multiplayer (excluding network) GPU > CPU > RAM > HDD.  If you have to sacrifice something, sacrifice the last items first based on what you will be playing most.  In any case try to reduce RAM or get a slower HDD before getting a slower CPU or GPU. \\n Better components in a system often make it run hotter, so make sure a laptop you like does not have heating problems before you buy it.  Otherwise you will end up like me and have to prop your laptop up on a wooden block to increase airflow the intake vents :) \\n Brands don\\'t usually matter, but the particular line of laptops often does.  Google your system to look for any common problems or annoyances. \\n These are not by any means the only things to consider when buying a laptop.  You should make sure it has a good screen, a comfortable keyboard, a non-glitchy touchpad, etc.  Most of these things will be in reviews, however. \\n REVIEW, REVIEW, REVIEW!  Google any system you start to like, because if it has a problem someone somewhere will have posted about it.  If a particular system has a fragile screen that likes to break and you plan to carry it in a backpack, it may not be a good idea. \\n \\n Sorry if this is not exactly the type of thing you were looking for, but I hope it helps!

Also, AMD\\'s cores are different than Intel\\'s cores, and have bad single core performance, which is why AMD CPUs have issues on some games (example: lower framerates on a few games, frame stuttering on some games). More cores does not mean more power in gaming. It\\'s about the quality of cores. An 8 core AMD CPU isn\\'t really a true 8 core CPU if you think about it. AMD shoves two cores into one \"module\" and has those cores share FPU, L1 cache, and L2 cache. You would need to overclock an 8 core AMD CPU close to 5.0 GHz or maybe more to get something close to the performance of a ~3.5GHz i5 or i7 processor in games. Hell even an i3 can do better in most games than a FX 6300 (6 \"core\" processor). \\n AMD processors are cheap for a reason, but that isn\\'t to say they are garbage. If you\\'re on a budget for gaming, an AMD processor paired with a mid range GPU would do you fine. But if you have more than $700 to spend, then Intel is the way to go. An AMD 8/6 \"core\" CPU is good for running things like Photoshop or encoding or streaming on a budget because those activities don\\'t really take a performance hit from AMD\\'s weaker cores.

It\\'s much, much more complex.  Ignoring computational cost of emulating this hardware in software, simply writing this emulator is a huge task.  It\\'s also hindered by the fact that the only people with such intense knowledge of the 360\\'s hardware are, most likely, engineers for Microsoft or game developers with much more profitable projects to work on.  I\\'m also assuming the internals of many of these chips is not common knowledge, not like the old consoles where all of the chips were \"off the shelf,\" had datasheets, uses in other machines, etc and were generally not difficult to find info on. \\n Now consider the computational cost.

       " Row(content=\"PCPartPicker]( appears to do a pretty good job showing you only the parts that are compatible with what you've already chosen. \\n A good place to start would be to choose what CPU you want. Your CPU choice will determine what kind of  CPU socket  you'll be using. Modern Intel CPUs use the LGA1155 socket, and therefore you'll want to get motherboards with a LGA1155 socket for the CPU. AMD CPUs, on the other hand, tend to use the AM3 or AM3+ sockets, which means you'll need a mobo with an AM3/+ socket. \\n Once you know what socket type you're using, the field of motherboards is narrowed down. Next, you might want to decide what size computer you'll be building to decide what size of motherboard to get. Motherboards come in different size  form factors , such as ATX, Micro ATX (aka mATX), or Mini ITX. For a normal-size computer you'll probably want a ATX motherboard to allow for maximum expandability. \\n Once you've chosen a motherboard form factor, you can choose a case that fits that form factor. \\n Your PSU form factor will also depend on the mobo form factor, but PSUs don't seem to be as finicky. You'll very likely be getting a ATX12 PSU. You'll also want to make sure your PSU has enough power to power all your stuff. Use [this tool]( to find how much wattage you'll need. \\n Next, you'll need to know what kind of video card you'll want so that you know what  expansion slot type  to make sure your motherboard has. You will almost certainly be getting a PCI-e card, since AGP is insanely out of date. There are different versions of PCI-e, such as 2.0 and 3.0, that describe how fast the PCI-e connection is, but I think any PCI-e version will work with any PCI-e card. I'd recommend going for PCI-e 3.0 though. There's not much else to worry about here...just know that if you plan on getting another expansion card (such as a nice sound card or a TV tuner), you'll need to check the slot type and make sure your motherboard has a slot for it. \\n Finally, you'll need to choose what kind of RAM you'll be needing. Motherboards specify what  RAM speed  they support, such as DDR, DDR2, or DDR3. Most modern boards are using the faster DDR3 RAM, so you'll need to make sure you get DDR3 sticks of RAM. \\n When it comes to hard drives and optical drives, there's not much competition. You'll be getting drives with SATA data connections. You won't be using the outdated IDE cables. \\n I think that covers it...I hope that helps.\", summary=\"You'll want a motherboard with PCI-e slots (2.0 or 3.0) and DDR3 RAM.

But in the real world, we deal with probability all the time. \\n Consider \"brain-in-a-jar\" scenarios.  You can\\'t  disprove  it, so the probability is > 0.  Which is to say, not False.

This is a far cry from saying \"if it is neither true nor false than we can\\'t know anything at all.\"  We can certainly assert weak or strong likelihood or unlikelihood without absolute dis/proof, and we frequently do.  It\\'s how you and I navigate the world around us. \\n The moment we step away from purely-abstract logical or mathematical constructions, that is, the moment we start to insert premises which are  intentional  (which is to say that they refer to real-world states of affairs), we start dealing with probabilistic scenarios.  As opposed to the perfect Truths or Falsehoods that abstract logic, resting atop its mighty Greek plinth, prefers to use in philosophy class examples. \\n This bears repeating: any proposition which refers to some real-world state of affairs is a type-P statement.  Neither provably True nor False, but always somewhere in between, subject to some greater-than-zero but less-than-perfect measure of probability or improbability.  There is no getting around this.  Somebody with credentials has most likely formulated it as a law somewhere.  If not, then they should get cracking on that, because it\\'s unavoidable. \\n Thus, the vast majority of statements about the real world (which is to say all statements relevant to our state of being) all happen in on a quantitative dial between those two extremes.  Never 0% nor 100%, but always some finite measure in between. \\n > Truth [is] an absolute correspondence between a statement and what is the case. \\n The problem is, the more narrowly precise your formal structure is (of perfectly interlocking definitions created to describe reality), the less likely it will accurately describe reality (and the converse).

That includes concepts like Truth, Falsehood and all the rules of formal/deductive logic.  But our experience presents itself to us as an unbroken whole; it is merely what it is, not what we call it or what we understand it to be.  We divide our experience and distinguish portions of it into concepts via some relational \"map\" in order to produce what we call \"knowledge\" of it.  But it\\'s important to remember that the map is not the thing.  It is merely the means by which we try to understand the thing.

One of the things you should understand about Mek is that the earlier you (read: the team) gets it the better. If you're 30 minutes into a game without a Mek you've probably already reached or are about to reach the end of that item's relative effectiveness. So making your hard 5 get a mek is generally a little silly unless you're ahead and involved in a lot of kills early. I realize that in a lot of pubs if you don't get it no one will, but honestly a force staff will probably save more lives than mek would by the time you got it. If you see heroes that can conceivably and maybe usually get mek (WR, Chen, DS, OD, etc.) maybe say soemthing in game asking them if they're going to get mek. \\n After that what boots are you building?

Urn is way cheaper than mek and the more kills you're involved in the more charges you get (side tip: its almost always better to have 0 charges in your urn than 1, because at 0 when you get a kill you will get 2 charges) and ultimately the thing that is great about CM is that she sustains long team fights better than almost any other support out there. Her aura means that your team is going to be getting more skills off than the other, couple that with tranquils keeping you on the scene for longer, and an urn... and well you're a significant presence that the other team likely isn't thinking about. \\n This got way longer than I intended.\", summary='CM is my favorite support currently.', author='Bewbtube', subreddit='DotA2', tickers=['META'], sentiment=0.0),\n",

Semi Geararmor and/or Limit Geargiagear \\n With a semi on Armor the deck can still search but will be forced to run the slower Geargias. Geargiagear is a really dumb card by its own, very few cards can summon single monsters from the deck, let alone two. It does not even negate their effects, which makes it even more dumb. Birdman should also be hit because of his combo with Geargiaccelerator, and because he generally allows really dumb plays and otks. This would presumably allow Divine Wind of Mist Valley to return to 2 or even 3. \\n Konami will also probably address our beloved Hoban Engine. \\n > Limit or Ban Upstart Goblin, Semi Reckless Greed \\n Konami hates cards that can be run in every deck (see Book of Moon) and Upstart can be run in virtually any deck. If your deck can create hard-to-remove boards with the right pieces, or OTK beyond 11000 LP, there's no reason why not to run this card. Reckless is also highly splashable, and since shooting off two in the same turn does not stack it's also a chainable huge plus. Hitting it to two means most decks will have to think if they want to run it and reduce its splashability. \\n The final big change I see is for Harpies, which is only fair if they are hitting all the current top decks: \\n > Hysteric Party to 1 \\n Same argument as Geargiagear, massive plusses and pushes for free.

Honestly Serpent or DMoC could come back and be as meaningless as Tsuku or Magician of Faith. Speaking of which, I haven't seen a single deck that runs Magician of Faith, and I doubt I will.

MAYBE has palm loops. otherwise, main thing to worry about is instant overhead air L with nova. i\\'ve noticed that the more seasoned novas ALWAYS go for it first over crouch M. i\\'ve tried to convince myself to just block high vs nova and react to crouch M but ya, online.. lol. even offline it\\'s pretty hard. i cant even tech obvious throw resets most of the time. mind the assist calls vs spencer, strange. zip bolts can be very random. they can delay the S to be front or crossover. depending on the timing, horizontal zip is throwable. if they do grounded horizontal zip to you, depending on the spacing, u can poke them before they touch the ground. when applying pressure, be weary of random arm or yolo piercer. also with overhead in between bolts pressure and command grabs, that shell is really tough to fight. strange is the weakest link to this team so try to get in his face before he can set up an eye, try to force random supers as they are relatively unsafe on block depending on how close you are. watch for raw teleports as they are very fast. \\n 5) 1st scout. wolvie, frank, vergil.\\nand the dark one finally makes his appearance. before i get to him, i\\'ll point on the other two. wolvie is probably gonna maul. very hard. depending on his competence, he may divekick all day, maybe more ground pressure with shopping cart. abc zerker slash or just light zerker slash + zerker charge. sometimes they\\'ll try not to power up to save for frank, but the goal is to level frank. with frank second, there\\'s a very good possibility he will tac. very rarely i see people with tac resets. the people that do do it with frank west sitting on deck are dirty, smart players. most randoms will tac for wutever reason, be it easy damage, laziness, lack of combo knowledge, trolling. upbacking divekick at a low height can net a punish for some characters, but it\\'s best to respect wolvie and to fight him far away if you can. might know the ricky special, but i rarely see that even for the 1%\\'ers. fighting frank can be tricky. super jump knee drops. abc into zombie throw or just raw zombie throw xx slide confirms. the slide is a big problem. it acts as an anti-air in most situations so dont fuck with it. leveled up, u may see a lot of rolling mix ups with assist calls. just have to be aware if the player is into that. generally lvl + franks jump around and do air M, so watch the dome. rarely anti air super. and the dark one. i would snap him in first. depending on if the guy plays like a nut or not, i\\'ll try to counter the helm breaker. you dont want to fight dark vergil. rapid slash all day, sword mix ups, round trip incoming. \\n 6) 4th ranger. hawkeye, dormmamu, raccoon\\nzoning! this dude intends to keep u on the other side of the screen and chip the shit out of you. hawkeye is a real problem online with the right assists. combos are probably not on this guy\\'s mind, but im sure he knows his basic otgs if he gets a throw. try to inch in little by little. having a projectile assist vs hawkeye is a godsend in closing the gap. just mind the calls in case of sniping withj gimlet. dormmamu random super is very effective and real. dark matter teleport mix ups, super jump cross fish hooks, raw S. just try avoid the mix ups if possible. raccoon zoning + log trap is disgusting. mind the calls, and try to rush him down before he gets traps up. \\n this only scratches the surface as what is out there, but the randomness is not absolute', summary='identify the gimmick, find what works well against it, blow um up', author='pantzerr', subreddit='MvC3', tickers=['META'], sentiment=0.0007570022717118263),\n",

I won one game with it once, ever. if you\\'re not familiar with Izzet Blitz, the entire point of the deck was playing a Cyclops on turn 3, and then casting a flurry of cheap spells on turn 4, the last of which was usually Artful Dodge after a Ready //, and you swung in with an 11/5 unblockable double-striker. gg lol sorry about your luck, right? \\n ...right? \\n no. allow me to introduce you to almost literally any kill/exile/bounce/fog effect at instant speed. the deck blew its\\' load turn 4, and if they had at least one mana up on their turn or just fucking removed your Cyclops on their turn, the deck had absolutely nothing left in the tank - you dumped a bit of your deck right into the graveyard just digging for the combo, and had no real way of recurring any of it at relevant speeds. \\n well, let\\'s take this deck to the drawing board. I have this combo, needs a creature to hit the board, live a turn, swing in. if I leave it as is, well, I lose to anyone who watches me get away with this game 1. that\\'s the truth. \\n if I start subbing out cards? well, there we go. I\\'m fucking metagaming whether I want to or not. I realize I have this jank combo deck that really has no options for game 2. every card in the deck pretty much makes the combo happen, or gives me a desperate attempt at a second chance if needed. I can go a little further in on the burn, giving me a Red Deck Wins feel with a blue splash for the Cyclops hilarity. \\n but, see? Metagaming. on my own fucking deck that I fucking brewed without help. I\\'m sitting here wondering whether or not I streamline it into jank RDW/blue splash, or maybe protect the combo with some counter-magic and shit like Mizzium Skin, giving me a potential late-game finisher in a blue tempo deck. \\n you know what happens? you set the deck down, because you realize that your pile of jank has a cute idea, and the core is so awesome... but, it\\'s totally  not  worth building a deck around. there are much better cards I could be playing in blue or red that don\\'t require as much all-in as a Nivix Cyclops. \\n well, so, what do you run in your controlly-tempo deck with a red splash as a real finisher? well, how about Aetherling? you only need one. \\n and soon enough, you\\'re looking at stock U/W control and realizing you should just be playing Jace/Elspeth/Rev/Verdict/D-Spheres.

(factorial) \\n So 450 parts would be [450!]( 450x449x448... etc. which comes out to 1.7x10^1000.  T \\n So how long would it take? \\n Well, let's say every atom in the universe was a supercomputer that re-rolled all the parts a billion times a second, and the entire system was networked so that the same combination was never rolled twice.  Let's say we began at the big bang (although the number of atom's wasn't the same at that point if there were any). \\n The current accepted  age of the universe \\n The amount of [atoms in the observable universe]( is estimated to be 10^82 \\n So how many iterations could we do with 10^82 computers going at a billion times(10^9) a second for 14 billion(1.4x10^10) years? \\n (60 seconds x 60 minutes x 24 hours x 365 days) = 3.1x10^7 seconds in a year. \\n (3.1x10^7 seconds) x (10^9 calculations per second) = (3.1x10^16 Calculations per year.) \\n (3.1x10^16 Calculations per year) x (10^82 atoms) = (3.1x10^98 Calculations per atom per year) \\n (1.4x10^10 years) x (3.1x10^98 Calculations per atom per year) =  (4.3x10^108) Calculations in 14 billion years. Or 430 googol. \\n How close is 430 googol to the 1.7x10^1000 iterations that we need?  You might think that 10^100 is 10% of 10^1000, but that is wrong. Multiplaying 10^100 by 10 only gives you 10^101!  And multiplaying it by another googol only gives you 10^200! \\n So after waiting 14 billion years, we aren't even near one googol of a percent!  How much longer do we need to wait? \\n We would divide the iterations we need, by the number of iterations per year to get the total number of years. \\n So (3.1x10^98 Calculations per atom per year) / (1.7x10^1000) = 1.8x10^902 years. \\n How long is this? \\n Well, another way to write that is 1.8E908. Let's just cut that in half to 1E908 and consult a [chart on the future of the universe]( \\n By the time all protons have decayed, and matter no longer exists, we're not even 1% of the way through our calculations.

We can't even line up 450 parts. \\n \\n The odds of a single average protein? \\n \\n Well, a protein is made up of many amino acids. Let's say the average length is 270 amino acids.  There are at least  500 known . \\n So we have a pure bath of 20 correct types of amino acids.  What are the odds of getting this 270 long chain of proteins? \\n When you roll one die, you have a 1/6 chance. When you want to roll correctly twice you have a 1/36 chance. or 6x6. \\n So we take our 1/20 chance amino acid, and correctly roll another... 270 times. so 20x20x20x20... 270 times. \\n or 10^270 x 2^270 = 1.97x10^351 combinations of 270.

That's just one protein. What are the odds of getting another?.  Well, like we did before, you multiply them together.  3 proteins later, and we've already passed 10^1000 ! \\n But we're not trying for 3, just one. So what would it take? \\n Well... there are [10^50]( atoms on earth. \\n For ease of argument, lets say every single atom was  actually one of 20 amino acids  a protein making machine with an endless supply of amino acids! An entire earth of illogical protein making madness! \\n \\n Can you see where we are going with this? \\n \\n How fast can we churn out proteins with this monstrosity?  Could it be done in 14 billion years? a single protein? What are the odds? \\n How fast can we go?  AMD has the fastest single super computer 2014 with a speed of (12 TFlops) or 12x10^15 calculations per second. Let's multiply that power by 8 for 100 Tflops or  10^16 \\n So lets say each of our 10^50 machines operated as fast as a current top supercomputer! \\n 10^50 x 10^16 =  10^66  chains of 270 amino acids per second!  What an explosion of mass! Our solar system would soon be one planet! \\n Could this beast crank out our needed protein in 14 billion years? (of course not) \\n 14 billion years x 365 days x 24 hours x 60 minutes x 60 seconds = 4.4x10^17. \\n So 10^66 x 4.4x10^17 = 4.4x10^83.

A report describing results from a single center participating in one of the fair-quality trials was also identified. Of the two highest-quality trials,  the U.S. Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial found no statistically significant effect of PSA-based screening on prostate cancer mortality after 10 years  (rate ratio [RR], 1.11 [95% CI, 0.83–1.50]).  The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer also found no statistically significant effect in all enrolled men (ages 50–74 years) after a median followup of 9 years  (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.73–1.00]), but reported a 0.07% absolute risk reduction in a prespecified subgroup of men aged 55 to 69 years (RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.65–0.98]).  Neither meta-analysis indicated a reduction in prostate cancer mortality with the use of PSA-based screening .  When a benefit was found, PSA-based screening resulted in an estimated 48 additional men being treated for each prostate cancer death that was averted.  Twelve percent to 13% of screened men had false-positive results after 3 to 4 screening rounds, and clinically important infections, bleeding, or urinary retention occurred after 0.5%–1.0% of prostate biopsies.', summary='PSA screening is controversial because of the high false positive rate, the natural history of most cases of prostate CA (most die with it, not from it) and the morbidity associated with treatment.', author='Iatros', subreddit='YouShouldKnow', tickers=['META'], sentiment=0.0),\n",

Some of the most painful deletions to make are often personal anecdotes - I still complain about one I had to remove where I guy wrote about growing up in Northern Ireland during the troubles (If you are reading this man, I\\'M SORRY!).

They come with vbios restrictions, for example, they only allow you to increase a maximum of +135Mhz on the core clock and voltage control is completely locked out. \\n Looks like this: \\n Dedicated gamers who knew their shit and enthusiasts managed to circumvent these restrictions by flashing modified vbioses. Also, this reasoning that it\\'s to hold the hands of stupid people could also be applied to desktop cards. In fact, it might be killed faster by someone\\'s ineptitude since they offer limited control of voltage and generally aren\\'t as locked down as much as laptop cards are. Will they start locking down desktop cards too for \"our safety\"? \\n \"Isn\\'t overclocking a laptop gpu a bad idea in the first place because of the increase in power and heat?\" \\n Now the major argument made is temperature, that laptops cannot adequately handle temps because they are all overheating pieces of shit. This is incorrect and is just pandering to the common opinion. A majority of people who have only used ultrabooks and low priced craptops from HP and dell do actually believe this but they are just as wrong as the peasants who ignorantly poke fun at PC gaming because their only experience with it are office prebuilts. Also, some people tend to go with ultra slim gaming laptops such as the razer blade and the msi gs60 which are pretty bad in the cooling department, cannot stay within acceptable temperatures and end up throttling in order to reduce temps. (Though this has improved with the release of maxwell cards which run even cooler than kepler). There are reasons that gaming laptops are generally thicker than ultrabooks and the most important one is adequate cooling. \\n Laptop cards do, in fact, overclock pretty well. Even kepler, which used more power and was hotter than maxwell, overclocked pretty well. From the  600 series \\n Maxwell ran cooler and overclocked incredibly well, even better than kepler. For example, a bench of an overclocked 970m shows the max temps at 71C: \\n Why did they do this? \\n While things have been going pretty well on the desktop side, there has been a lot of half assed efforts for money grabbing on the laptop side for a while now. AMD decided to rebrand and re-release the same 7970m from 2012 as the 8970m with the only difference being 4gb of vram and higher clocks. Then, they released the R9 M290X which was just the 8970m with an even higher factory overclock. So the same card was released three times with higher clocks each time to make it perform better on benchmarks and fool people into thinking that they were actually getting something better. Similarly, on the green side, the 670mx was again released as the 770m with higher clocks, the 880m was just an overclocked 780m with a ridiculous amount of vram tacked on (8gb). While the desktop flagship 780ti had just 3gb of vram, they decided to do this to a lower powered laptop card which would never use that much memory and sold it at higher prices. The 870m was just a crippled 680m with a 192bit buswidth and 6gb of vram rather than the 256bit bus and 4gb vram of the 680m. However, the 870m outperforms the 680m at stock because they came with higher clock speeds. When both are overclocked, the 870m is left in the dust because the 680m has better hardware. \\n So they release laptop cards with low clock speeds and later on, release them again with another name but with higher clockspeeds to fool unsuspecting customers. Now they want to prevent us from overclocking which means that they might release a 980mx or 980m ti a year later which could be just a factory overclocked 980m but since overclocking is prevented, you will have to buy the same card again to get performance you should already have. \\n Read more here: \\n and', summary='Nvidia is locking things for our \"safety\" and some people who are not directly affected by it believe that its justified because it keeps stupid people from destroying their stuff.', author='crest123', subreddit='pcmasterrace', tickers=['AMD'], sentiment=0.0011520737316459417),\n",

I'll do a bit of comparison, because I think people need to understand that if every guardian ran your build, the group would lose--in order of importance--a lot of damage potential, some stability, and some condition removal. \\n You basically give up three key things (purging flames, bomb/nuke damage, and traited virtue of courage for stability) for some extra healing, mostly symbols. \\n You say that your role isn't to deal damage, but that's not true.  Guardians using gs4 then gs2 on the bomb call is very important, and a few gs2's can be the difference between downs and no-downs. And your staff cleave is also going to suck if you're not in mostly power-primary gear. Mace might put out solid damage, but I think we can agree that it does not spike like gs2 and it doesn't cc like hammer 3. And we can probably also agree that you'll do even less damage when you mix in clerics/settlers/nomad pieces. \\n Wall of reflection is good, but not that great because most of the bomb damage is from wells, meteor showers, lava fonts, and melee cleave--that is, the damage spike is not affected. Purging doesn't directly affect them either, but it helps you get out of it by wiping or keeping chill/immob off everyone. I think reflect is great in many situations, in fact one guy in the group should have it without a doubt, but I think default should still be purging flames. Basically, wall vs purging is a separate discussion from the builds, since both builds have master of consecrations. \\n Running traited book is a solid choice if your group has enough stability and not enough healing, but really even then I don't think it's worth dropping your second source of stability just to trait it for selfish stability and longer duration. Book is amazing if your group is low on eles (i.e., low on water to the point where you need the book aa heals) AND you are a pro player who never needs the invuln from renewed focus. But losing the stab-on-F3 is especially bad because your normal source of stability (SYG) isn't traited for short recharge. Simply put, I disagree with dropping indomitable courage (stab on F3) for elite focus (traited book). Use book, it's great, but don't trait it. \\n Oh and you traded AH for the symbol length GM trait. That's still kind of ridiculous, even within this build where you are relying on symbols. AH is just so ridiculously good, it makes every virtue heal you for another 350ish on activation (due to inspired virtue minor trait), and it makes symbols pulse a 300ish heal on you (assuming 4 allies + you are getting boons), and it turns empower into a divine gift.

When AMD did a 64bit processor, they called it \"AMD64\" and set the standard. Intel then gave the market their first one, called Itanium or ia64.

Windows soon left the 16-bit world with windows 95^1 and thus, the term \"win32\" became synonymous with \"windows application\".

So, they teamed up with Microsoft. \\n Only new-ish (I say this liberally, as some devices had it before others, etc) Intel chips had PAE enabled, so they started getting with Microsoft to make it so that they could dominate the server market.

       " Row(content='Hey!  My lab does this work I\\'ve answered the question a few times before, but should probably do a better write up so you\\'ll get a fresh answer!  The evidence is ambiguous, mostly because a lot of the studies that have found promising results also leave us with some questions about the strength of their methods.  The two biggest researchers you\\'ll hear about are [Susanne Jaeggi]( who has found some quite remarkable results in brain training.  The second person is [Randy Engle]( who is quite skeptical of the idea.  I\\'ll get into both of their work shortly, but they both have published numerous articles that support their own arguments and conflit with the opposing view point. \\n On Working Memory: \\n First, a bit of background.  Specifically, most of the work in brain training focuses around the idea of improving working memory, so called \"working memory training.\"  Now you may ask why, or first, what is working memory?  Working memory is the ability to hold information in mind (just like short term memory) and to manipulate that information (a process called updating).  Working memory requires attention to be paid to either internal or external representations of objects in order for that information to be maintained  (1) .  In his famous paper, \"[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two]( George Miller argued that you could hold 7 items in working memory at any one time, plus or minus 2 depending on individual differences.  Now, there are different things that influence this, such as how similar words are.  Words in the same category will allow you remember more, but also may lead to false positives.  But this is the basic idea of working memory. \\n So why improve working memory?  Well, working memory is a promising target because it is strongly correlated with nearly every positive trait you can imagine, from memory to attention to intelligence quotients, to be able to improve it, and possible improve those other cognitive domains, would be huge.  This brings up another issue, the question of transfer.  Specifically, we refer to two types of transfer, near transfer, which is the transfer of say improved working memory to mental rotation, versus far transfer, which would be something like improved working memory to reading comprehension. \\n On Methodology: \\n Working memory training studies like to utilize what is known as a n-back task.  This task shows you an image, say an apple, and asks you if it was the same image as the image that was displayed n images ago.  So if you\\'re doing a 2-back, and had the order go banana -> apple -> apple, 2-back would be a banana, which does not match apple, so the correct response is no.  This is important because it requires an individual to both hold the information in mind (both 2 back and 1 back, since 1 back will be 2 back on the next trail) but also it requires people to update the information in working memory.  We use the term n-back to refer to the fact that it is adaptive, the better you do, the higher the n goes and the more difficult the task becomes. \\n The method of these studies is also important, as I mentioned above, their\\'s been some contraversy about this.  Specifically, a study that aims to show an intervention should have a few qualities, which you may be familiar with from things like clinical trails.  Firstly, they must have a control group, a group which is doing a similar activity that would induce an equal placebo effect as the intervention, while not being beneficial in its own right.  Secondly, a study should be randomized and double-blind.  Randomized means that the process which places individuals in the placebo or the intervention condition, should be random (or as close to random as we can get.)  Double-blind means that both the participants in the experiment and the researchers conducting the experiment are both \\'blind\\' or unaware of who is in the experimental condition and who is in the placebo condition. \\n A Short Look of the Literature: \\n Phew, okay, now, onto actually answering your question, sorry for the detour!  Jaeggi\\'s biggest paper from 2008  (2)  found distant transfer from an n-back task to improved ability on  Raven\\'s Advanced Progressive Matrices ** found that, in elementary aged children, fluid intelligence was increased in those who showed the greatest gains in the training task, and this study had an active control group. \\n Randy Engle\\'s biggest paper  (4)  showed no transfer effects to any domain, they had three groups, a no-contact control group (similar to Jaeggi\\'s 2008 control group), a visual search control group, and a n-back experimental group.  They used ~14 different tasks to measure transfer effects, and performed the cognitive assessments at the start of training, in the middle, and at the end.  Now his study wasn\\'t double-blind, but his results, or lack there of, were staggering none the less. \\n It\\'s important to note, both groups argue that more research needs to be conducted, there is a lot of evidence on both sides, a recent meta-analysis  (5)  found that in general, there may be a small effect of cognitive training, but that result was not significant. \\n Lumosity has been attending conferences with their data set of 100,000 individuals.  They found a few cool things, first that the more you practice the better you do, and that this effect is attenuated by your age, so older adults need more training than younger adults for similar results.  This is most likely due to decreased neuroplasticity (ability for the brain to change itself) in older adults.', summary='The evidence is on both sides but it seems to be leaning towards yes, it does work.

That doesn’t really help the necro’s desirability since there is basically nothing they can do any other class can’t do better: \\n 1) Bad DPS. That’s both burst and sustained. Daggers + minions output okay DPS (slightly higher than warriors) on a single target but the conditions for reaching that damage are much more difficult to meet and due to minion AI and unsustainable cooldowns on summons (as opposed to mesmers who can just resummon phantasms quickly) there’s no way to necros to operate as an effective minion AI class. Well burst DPS is average at best and compared to other classes with much higher burst potential (thieves, guardians, warriors, eles) wells are nothing special especially given the severe sustained DPS loss after the initial burst. \\n 2) Bad survivability. Despite having high health and the extra Death Shroud life pool, necros get screwed in a lot of “one shot kill” fights because they lack vigor or other defensive cooldowns. Necros are pretty much always the first down on a slow Alpha kill because they’re the only class that can’t avoid the spike burst more than three times in a row and Death Shroud isn’t enough to absorb all that damage. On top of that, being tanky doesn’t even help the group because you can’t hold aggro in this game. \\n 3) Poor offensive support. Despite having a bunch of skills that allow the necro to buff itself (i.e. Blood is Power) the necro lacks ways to buff up other players. That means that all you’re doing is mitigating your own bad DPS at best, compared to the ranger and warrior. who also have relatively bad DPS but make up for it by boosting the rest of the team’s DPS significantly via area buffs like spirits, banners, and might/fury. \\n 4) Poor defensive/utility support. Guardians, thieves and mesmers have, by default, tons of reflects, condition removal, block, blinds, stability, etc. to buff other party members, while engineers and elementalists pump out raw healing numbers like nothing, even on a full DPS spec. These aren’t always necessary (sometimes they are) but they certainly don’t hurt. By comparison, the necro has?

       " Row(content='But is that a problem inherent of Doublelift or a problem of the team itself? Despite being the captain, Doublelift doesn\\'t actually make any in game shot calling (as stated by everyone by now it\\'s Link and Aphro in the late game with Dexter making decisions early about objectives). And he has no say in the overall team strategy, that is what they have Zikz and Montecristo for and I doubt he is saying \"Nah fuck that plan\" in champ select. Just because CLG fixates on bottom is not the fault of Doublelift, but a fault of the mentality of the team. Can you argue CLG plays this style because Doublelift is there? Yes. But CLG as a team gravitates around Double (or moreso Double + Aphro), it\\'s not Double forcing them. \\n Also, how long has Link had to prove himself on the team? And this is another example of how in playoff/pressure situations he doesn\\'t show up. Link and Dexter also have incredibly glaring differences in playstyle. Link is always very reserved and passive in laning phase (outlier games notwithstanding, I know he HAS gone ham and carried but it\\'s not consistent enough) whereas Dexter really just kind of goes ham whenever he thinks it\\'s a good idea no matter what. Without Link to push up/pressure the mid lane, Dexter dies a lot when he tries to make aggressive plays in the enemy jungle. Especially if the enemy mid laner is particularly safe/has an escape/still has flash, Dexter can\\'t really convert anything around mid lane. Ganking is a waste of time and he can\\'t pressure the enemy jungler by invading/fighting/deep warding. Vision is also one of the most important components of the objective/outrotating playstyle that Monte is trying to craft for them and brought them the most success earlier this season. \\n Seraph still has looked fairly uncomfortable, the meta still is not his style and even he made a statement on twitter saying something to the effect of his team play improving but his mechanics have deteriorated. This already sets up a poor situation for CLG to be investing resources in Seraph. Top lane also does not really snowball in an impactful way through laning advantages in most cases (when there are huge tanks going at it like Maokai and Alistar and Mundo) and instead has to impact the game through TP (which although it can be coordinated with the jungler, is inherently the top laner investing/sacrificing resources for another lane or the team overall). Also factor in that 1v1s and 2v2s and standard laning is much more common now due to tower/dragon changes, so Dexter already needs to focus more on the bottom side of the map. We also know that even in the very beginning of the season where the games were much lower impact (and therefore lower pressure), Seraph suffered from anxiety/nerves and it affected his performance. He has improved that, but there is still no evidence of his being able to show up in a playoff situation, and decent evidence that he may indeed have issues performing in an even higher pressure environment. So Seraph is a pretty weak choice to invest in currently (although I feel there is hope his team play definitely has improved. Once his mechanics are back up to par and with Nidalee becoming a dominant top lane pick again, he could become more of a carry). \\n It also logically doesn\\'t make sense for Dexter to not gank the lane that has the highest chance of winning/is typically winning/is already ahead. Link and Seraph are never the ones that are able to create any advantages on their own. Even in solo queue people know to never gank the losing lane. At best you stem the bleeding but create no advantage, at worst you get counterganked and die in the 2v2 that they are already ahead in and it snowballs further. \\n If Link and Seraph could play aggressively/control their lane, not only does that open up opportunities/options for Dexter as a jungler that were previously very risky/unsafe, but it alleviates the pressure on bottom lane as well. Doublelift and Aphromoo have shown that laning is typically their strength and are good/aggressive enough to typically get ahead 2v2, even without Dexters help. They are also well adjusted to having a high amount of focus from the enemy team and (I feel) are capable of safely playing a lane out if the camp is too real. They can function as a separate 2 man cell from the rest of the team and usually create some advantage, which is a huge boom IF Link and Seraph step up their game because it can either keep the jungler bottom or give Rush Hour the chance to carry 2v2 (and have dragon control). Doublelift also alleviates a different kind of pressure; he draws bans. CRS banned his Vayne and Twitch all throughout the playoff series (after they made the mistake of giving him Twitch in the first game but despite a good performance at first CLG threw it). That opens up CLG to get some really strong early draft champions, and other North American ADCs don\\'t draw champion bans like Doublelift does (if an ADC is banned then it\\'s typically either straight OP and banned against all teams or is a playstyle that the enemy team doesn\\'t want to deal with, not targeted at an individuals performance on it. This also not to say that I don\\'t think Sneaky is really good and deserves bans, perhaps even more than Doublelift, but he still doesn\\'t pull them like Double does). He also has proven that he can perform well consistently over a long period of time (looking at his play only, not CLGs placings as a team) although it is arguable that he may have playoff performance issues considering he has never won a tournament. I do feel that Doubles performance had dropped a moderate amount before going to Korea, and it is difficult to evaluate his performance now out of 3 games vs CRS where after the first loss CLG was obviously all tilting hard. So far it seems he is still not back to the level he was at earlier this season, but it\\'s a very small sample size. Not to mention you would be throwing away the synergy that Aphro and Double have (which I find surprising that nobody is mentioning, especially considering Aphro became a support under Doublelift and hasn\\'t played competitively with any other AD). Rush hour has been the rock (or even crutch) of CLG all this season, both in successes and losses, and breaking up the strongest part of a team from a managerial standpoint would be pretty dumb (barring internal/personal issues between players). \\n So', summary=\"CLG focusing around Doublelift isn't a problem that Doublelift is creating, it is a flaw in CLGs mentality that needs to be addressed with the other players/analysts/coaches or whoever is creating it. \\n \\n CLG doesn't have realistic carry options in Link and Seraph right now so Dexter has no choice but to focus bottom \\n \\n Doublelift + Aphro can survive as their own entity, win lane 2v2, and are the rock of the team. \\n \\n Double brings a focus to him and off of other players (be it bans or pressure in game) \\n \\n The only basis for Doublelift not playing is if he willingly chooses to retire or if his mechanical performance continues to slump\", author='Landalin', subreddit='CLG', tickers=['META'], sentiment=-0.0008896797080524266),\n",

It just lacks complexity (though I admit that I like complex games, obviously it\\'s enough for many ppl). \\n But this is where Space engineers kicks in.\\nIn space engineers I constantly find new stuff to build because the way the sandbox system is designed it gives you oh so many possibilities: rotating and moving parts on your ship, sensors, the ability to merge and unmerge your ship with other entities (torpedo frigates ftw) and the timer blocks combined with the sensors give the possibility to implement (very simple) programming. You can push this very far, just have a look into the subreddit. Automated or remote controlled ships, intelligent torpedos, automated hangar doors, ... All possible.\\nAlso the game has survival and creative mode, both good designed with their unique challenges.\\nThere are two big downsides in space engineers though. First, no enemy ships. I mean, yes, you can enable \"cargo ships\" on the map that can grade up to big well armed military ships that you can capture, but they are not really controlled. The \"autopilot\" just moves the ship along a straight line and shoots with its turrets at you. No fighters, no dogfighting ai.\\nSecond, nothing to explore. You only have your starting asteroids that you can mine or build on, but other than that, space is empty. No planets, no bases, no other asteroid clusters. Combined with the lack of true enemy ships, this means that the game is dangerously low on meta-game, and you\\'ll have to find your own goals to keep going.\\nThis changes if you play in multiplayer, you can create factions, have dogfights, tear other battleships apart... Or play it as coop. The problem is that the game performance is (or was, only played so lately) very, very bad. Major lagging issues (not because of bad connectivity but because of bad code) prevented us from getting far in mp. \\n The space engineers workshop content on steam has some great stuff on it. I don\\'t know if starmade features this as well, when I played it there were no mods (at least none that I was aware of). But as I said, this might be outdated so I won\\'t talk anymore about this. \\n So we have metagame against building complexity. But the most important reason why I always would choose space engineers over starmade: I have much more faith in the developers of space engineers (keen software house) than I have in the developer of starmade (Robin Promesberger). Even without my distrust in one-person-developed games I experienced weekly updates in space engineers, and each time I thought \"yes, this is exactly what was missing\". They seem to listen to the community. In the past weeks they have been focussing on bug fixes and performance as they have implemented all major features they wanted for release date. This IMO again shows that they know what they are doing and have a plan (or at least think about what they are doing).\\n In starmade, the game engine is more limited straight away. There were occasional patches, it went forward, but just not in a that brilliant direction as space engineers. And I\\'m pretty sure that the space engineers engine is way more expandable. What they don\\'t have today (regarding major features such as good enemy ai or metagame)they might have in a few months. \\n Oh, and space engineers graphics are waaaaaaaaaay better.

       " Row(content=\"I used to play Visage quite regularly a few months back, but I was compelled to stop when I felt how useless he was in the meta. \\n In 6.80, Visage was nerfed by giving the familiars magic immunity as opposed to 96% magic resistance. This allowed Tinker to just destroy Visage's familiars. With the popularity of Tinker at the time, it was impossible to play Visage - being on Tinker's team means it is difficult for you to get the farm you require to keep your familiars relevant, and being on the opposing team means your ultimate is effectively negated. This is not to mention the popularity of heroes like Tidehunter (Anchor Smash), Razor (Eye of the Storm), Ember Spirit (Sleight of Fist) and to a lesser extent, Faceless Void (Chronosphere) who made life hell for any Visage. Also take into mind that this was the era of the deathball pushing strategy which Visage can do nothing about with his lack of counter push abilities. \\n Then came 6.82. Tinker was nerfed which breathed some life into Visage's viability. Unfortunately, 6.82 brought about problems of its own when it introduced tanky supports such as Ogre Magi and unkillable cores such as Phantom Assassin (especially when paired with Omniknight). While it may have been possible to work around these new threats, in addition to the still ubiquitous Void, Tidehunter, Razor cores, it was still quite difficult to justify having a Visage on the team. \\n Then comes the current 6.83 patch. While Razor and Phantom Assassin might be seeing a drop in popularity, Slark, QoP, and Ember Spirit is seeing a resurgence, making Visage a burdensome support with its lack of a proper disable. Basically, nothing much has changed since 6.82, which is bad for Visage. \\n Of course, there are some niche strategies where Visage is still viable, such as in the Cloud 9's Visage Drow classic. Unfortunately, this is very difficult to pull off. With a squishy core Drow, the team almost requires another tanky core to stay in the frontlines, and will also require a support who has decent counter push potential, and other cores with burst potential for the team to be able to take proper team fights. The strategy also heavily depends on the team allotting Visage position 3 farm in the early-mid game to get his quick and Aghanims and preferably level 11.

Also, AP carries tend to beat AD carries mid because their harass does more damage and does not aggro minion waves (e.g. Kassadin Q versus Ashe autoattack, even with the guaranteed crit). Finally, AP scales better with levels than AD carry because their damage comes mainly from spells, so an extra level increases their spell damage significantly. \\n In contrast, AD/lvl is fairly low, so an AD carry's damage is not as dependent on levels and much more on items, as spells are used more for utility (e.g. Tristana W or Caitlyn W). \\n The first reason (squishy with no escape) is the main reason that AD used to go mid. I also think this may have been a holdover from DotA days (correct me if I'm wrong, I never really got into DotA). Some AD carries are still viable mid, such as Tristana, Ezreal, and Caitlyn, who play more like casters earlygame and have strong escapes. However, there is no reason to run two AD carries and gimp your earlygame-midgame, and not every AP carry benefits from going bot (perhaps Veigar/Soraka? Although I think Infuse isn't enough to address Veigar's laning issues, he just uses TOO MUCH MANA on anything except Q farming and basically has to blow his whole mana bar to do anything other than farm, after which, win or lose, he probably will have to b). \\n Bruisers tend to have blinks/escapes and generally be tankier and more sustainable. Top lane is longer and has more effective gank paths, so this is important to not die to jungle all the time. Also, since top tends to be a little disconnected from the rest of the team earlygame, champions with sustain are stronger because they can hold lane forever without going back. \\n AD/support bot is because AD needs a solo lane farm but doesn't really need solo lane XP, while the same is usually true for support (minus the farm). \\n Good support characters have a lot of utility on their non-ult spells (Taric stun/heal/armor buff, Soraka silence/heal/manaheal, Alistar knockup/knockback/heal), so it's okay for them to be, say, level 5 during the first dragon fight. High utility means that they do not need  AP/AD to be useful in a fight. \\n These two go well together because AD carries are just as squishy as AP carry, and generally have no sustain except for some lifesteal from Doran's Blades. Supports help them farm longer and place wards to prevent ganks, as well as help harass the enemy laners and generally keep them off the AD's back. Finally, supports help otherwise fairly weak earlygame AD carries to make plays and get kills, helping them snowball into lategame. \\n The AD/support meta exploded at Dreamhack, where EU swept the tournament and generally dominated all the top NA teams because of the high efficiency of the strategy. Of course, at the time they ran double AP most of the time, but bruisers have just come to dominate top lane much better for the reasons I stated (this is a throwback to the so-called tanky DPS meta). Double AP still works, but often that extra beefiness/utility that many bruisers bring is more helpful to the team than more AP burst, since AP casters fall off lategame anyways and bruisers generally support the AD carry better in teamfights (compare a Cho'gath or Udyr top versus an Anivia or Cassiopeia top). \\n At the time NA played mostly AD mid, AP top, tank/support bot. This is inefficient because tanks and supports tend to split CS in bot, but support has limited uses for the cash. Also, since most tanks and bruisers have high sustain, the heals on supports are wasted in that lane. Many tanks go in the jungle, and a second tank is not useful (you do not need Rammus and Amumu on the same team, for example). If you replace it with a bruiser, however, they get little benefit from having a support babysitting them. \\n AP top tended to be susceptible to ganks, and also tend to lose against bruisers in lane as they get out-sustained. \\n Essentially, NA meta's top and mid lanes couldn't win their lanes against EU meta's lanes, and bot lane could play passive against a more agressive tank/support lane and still get enough CS to do well. EU lanes were harder to gank as well. \\n Is the current meta the perfect meta? Who knows.

However, recently, we've seen alternate comps run successfully (I forget who, but someone recently ran Karthus/Soraka bot). Of course, the amount of difference is minimal (Karthus is a sustained damage dealer and thus benefits as much from AP as levels, and Soraka's Infuse is useful for a spammy AP champ; the reasoning is much the same as AD/support). EG also ran comps without an AD carry at MLG Providence, but the jury is still out since it wasn't quite that successful against TSM's more standard setup in most of the games.\", summary='AP needs levels and safety so goes solo mid.

Therefore, this explanation is NOT suitable for a 5 year old, but I'll try to stick to layman terms. \\n They used to employ a 4 number naming system (i.e.: xxxx GTX/GT) up until a few years ago, and then switched to a 3 number system (i.e.: GT/GTX xxx) [Lowercase x's are numbers]. So with Nvidia cards, you can safely assume any graphics card with 3 numbers (like the GTX 660) is newer than one with 4 numbers (like the 6800 GT). \\n Since they haven't released a 4 number card in years, I'm going to disregard them from here on. \\n Of the 3 numbers, the first describes which generation the card belongs to. So a GTX 4xx is a few generations older than a GTX 6xx. They've managed to fuck this up too by falsely renaming cards, etc; but the golden rule you can count on is\\n If the middle number is the same, the card with the higher first number is better. \\n i.e.: If you take a GTX 460, 560, 660; you can assume 460 < 560 < 660. Sometimes the difference can be tiny, sometimes it can be huge, but this is the only concrete rule. \\n So what if the second number is not equal? That's where things get tricky. If the second number is low, say equal to or below 5,\\n A card from generation (N) is better than a card of the previous generation (N-1) with the middle number increased by 1. \\n i.e.: A GT 520 would be around equal to or better than a GT 430. \\n Note that this rule is usually true for higher middle numbers, but there are exceptions and sometimes there are huge price differences, so you'll want to do more research into the cards you're comparing. \\n So what about cards with  m  (laptop/mobile chips)? \\n This is ultra super duper clusterfucked. 6xx cards higher than the 660m are a mix of the desktop 5 and 6 generation, while cards lower than it are equal to the 5xxm cards with one added to the middle number.

       " Row(content='The factors effecting the ocean\\'s ecosystems are multifactorial and fish farming only attempts to solve one of those factors: over fishing. Just for background (I don\\'t know how much you know). \\n Background \\n Fish are renewable resource so long as we don\\'t take more then they be can replenish - in the same way trees are renewable resource so long as we plant new ones once we chop the old ones down. Currently for many fish stocks we are harvesting and consuming them at unsustainable rates - which means we potentially and likely will run out of certain fish species. (Example: Blue Fin Tuna). They are projected to become extinct within a few years due to overfishing. We aren\\'t letting enough fish live in order for certain species to reproduce. (i.e. we are cutting down trees without planting new ones) \\n The problem with fish is that the older a fish gets the more fecund it is (the more offspring it produces) but we also like to consume these fish because they are the big meaty ones. We are essentially consuming the part of the life cycle that is most important to insure the continued reproduction of a fish species. If we catch all the old fish, then what tends to happen are there are not enough baby fish being born. The funny thing is with some fish species need a certain population density to breed. Meaning, they need some amount of breeding adults to produce enough eggs and sperm so that the densities are high enough that they actually get fertilized. If we mess up stocks enough, they never recover, because they are below the threshold of recovery. For example: [Atlantic Cod]( \\n No amount of new technology will allow us to extract more from 99% of the already over exploited populations. In many ways we have hit our peak extraction rate - basically we are maxing out on what we can take out of the oceans. Moreover, reducing fish population levels actually changes the structure of the food web - species like lobster, crab and jelly fish are increasing in numbers filling in the gaps left behind by reduced fish stocks. This is a double hit 1. It makes it harder for fish stocks to recover because the niches have been filled by other species. and 2. It makes it seem like its boom time for the lobster and crabbing industries...when really we should be extra cautious about not overexploiting them in the same way. We are fishing down the [food web]( and destroying it in the process. \\n Its not all doom and gloom though: Of the stocks that are doing well its usually because they are too far out (meaning that the energy required to catch them - time to go out, time to pay fisherman, gas which all add up to $) is less then what you get when you sell them at market. To make up for this loss many governments subsidize the fishing industry, meaning they pay fisherman to go out an fish even if it costs more then its worth. Sometimes stocks are doing well because they are being protected and regulated. But this often is enough to ensure that the species is not overexploited the oceans are an interconnected ecosystem. Its not like land, where there are more or less separate areas. What happens in one end of the Atlantic effects the southern end, one side of the pacific the other. So that if stalks in general are declining the very fabric of the food web is weakening, if we reduce species to levels that are practically extinct for all intents and purposes this will negatively effect our \"good\" stocks. \\n Moreover, policies put into place to day to protect fish stocks are ineffective, and we are deluding ourselves if we think otherwise. Laws and quotas that one country sets may not be the same laws and quotas that another sets - yet the fish migrate throughout both regions and are being hit twice as hard. Some examples of regulatory processes include: \\n \\n Marine protected areas  and only if this is enforced by law. The last I looked MPA\\'s represented under 5% of the total world ocean surface. Moreover only a fraction of these are 100% no take zones, usually some sort of fishing or trapping can take place. This does not help migratory fish species or ones that breed in open water. As soon as they leave these protected areas they are allowed to be caught. \\n \\n Max sustainable Yeild (MSY): fancy language for saying how much fish you should catch based on how big a stock is, how many fish are in each age-sex class (infant, juvenile, adult, old adult) and still make it sustainable. The biggest problem here is that there are hundreds of ways to calculate MSY and few of them actually agree with each other and most do not take into account that other predators in the sea (sharks, other fish) need to eat too. Moreover, calculating (estimating) how many fish are in each age-sex class correctly can be a nightmare - if you don\\'t get the actually population numbers right how do you know how many you can fish?. Different countries set different limits, there is little agreeance. We also tend to think extracting 50-80% of a prey species (like fish) is sustainable, when in nature predators never exceed 20% of their prey stock, and usually they sit around 5-10%. So we are acting like \\'super predators\\' and this is not sustainable. MSY and other calculations have proved questionable in the past, it is not a reliable way to fish sustainably. \\n \\n Nobody is policing the oceans. So if I wanted to go out and fish the crap out of an endangered species I would have (relatively) no problem doing so. A good case: ban on whaling. Bad case: illegal whaling still continues. \\n \\n \\n More on Fish Farming \\n The good \\n \\n There are many kinds of fish farming which have different impacts on the environment and on the health of the fish we raise. Some are terrestrial \\n \\n Can relieve some pressure of over fishing associated with wild stocks but we really need more data on this \\n \\n Can target species you want to consume more effectively. There is a lot of by catch associated with fishing wild stocks. We are incredibly inefficient. Fish farms allow us to target species. \\n \\n \\n The Bad \\n \\n Can be a great source of disease. For example: fish lice in salmon. Because the fish farms are located near wild populations habitat the disease or the parasite can be transferred more easily to wild populations. \"A 2008 meta-analysis of available data shows that salmon farming reduces the survival of associated wild salmon populations. This relationship has been shown to hold for Atlantic, steelhead, pink, chum, and coho salmon. The decrease in survival or abundance often exceeds 50 percent.\" \\n \\n Does not actually solve the overfishing problem because people like to eat higher up on the marine food web. I.E. you would rather eat a tuna then a jelly fish. Problem is that it takes small fish (like anchovies) to feed big fish. All we end up doing is overfishing the small guys (base of the food web) which really messes with the ecosystem and it does nothing to curb our appetite for large energetically and ecologically costly fish. [More on fish feed or fish meal]( \"Aquaculture\\'s heavy reliance on wild caught seed and broodstock is of increasing concern. Fishmeal and its source of raw materials and costs are highly debated by scientists and conservationists. Since fishmeal uses wild fish stock to feed farmed fish, this places direct pressure on fisheries resources. Indirect effects are also apparent such as diminishing wild fisheries, habitat modification and food web interactions.\" \\n \\n In some places there are not a lot of laws or regulations set up, the farmed fish you are getting could be unhealthy. Full of [lice]( or [additives like astaxanthin which dye farmed salmon pink]( \\n \\n More on dye: I should note that wild salmon is pink because of its diet. In farms they do not get the same diet and so they are not as pink. People choose pink salmon because it looks better, so marketers add a synthetic compound to the salmon \"feed\" which makes them pink. Its not a dye injected into the salmon but it is still not \"natural\". [More on dye]( \\n \\n More on lice: \"Large numbers of highly populated, open-net salmon farms can create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice; when exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open-net farms, many young wild salmon are infected, and do not survive as a result\" \\n \\n \\n \\n Under certain conditions it is as seen as in humane: \"Secondly, farmed fish are kept in concentrations never seen in the wild.) with each fish occupying less room than the average bathtub\". This leads to increased pollution and hurts fish when they are forced to rub up against one another. It also causes the animals to be stressed. Fish do feel pain and stress and so IMO it is inhuman to keep them in such cramped quarters. Serious regulation needs to be put in place like has been down for the cattle industry, poultry industry etc. (Not that those are perfect either). \\n \\n The use of antibiotics: \"Because of parasite problems, some aquaculture operators frequently use strong antibiotic drugs to keep the fish alive (but many fish still die prematurely at rates of up to 30 percent[26]). In some cases, these drugs have entered the environment. Additionally, the residual presence of these drugs in human food products has become controversial.\" \\n \\n \\n Here is the article on [Fish Farming]( Most of my information comes from salmon fish farming which is popular in BC, Canada. \\n [And more on Salmon]( \\n How do we fix this problem? \\n \\n Stop trawling \\n \\n Stop using technology that takes fish at faster rates then they can reproduce \\n \\n Ban and enforce fishing moratoriums on endangered fish species like the blue fin tuna.

Perhaps they didn't want to play with the others, maybe they thought they might arrange a better deal/cut for themselves, maybe the principles involved in brokering the deal were no longer with the company in with the same management spec.  It could be as simple as the government getting thrown out of office or the Minister of SpecialProject getting reassigned to minister of OtherThing. \\n Anyways, back to the project.  It's been around for a decade and I was able to track it's progress.  Went from 'good initial developmental prognosis' to 'excellent developmental prognosis' to 'satisfactory' to 'concerned' to 'highly concerned'.  Something along the way had gone poorly and now it showed.  Looking at the invididual report, it's hard to see the change but in context you can see the nuance of the language and glean how the project somehow went wrong.  Might even be able to attempt to ascertain when and why.  The important thing here is that long term context matters. \\n But I still haven't answered the question, why the wishywashy language. \\n It's political . \\n That's kind of short form, let me explain.  The wishywashy language allows a local broker wiggle room to spin a project.  If the representative goes back to country X and boardroom Y, the broker can up-spin or down-spin a project.  Said government/boardroom can up-sell or down-sell a project.  Whether this project has to be sold further into a boardroom or government or to the people/constituents/other team members is moot, just that the possibility is there. \\n Now, irrespective of the merit of the project, the 'deciders' in an aspect of the project  need  this wiggle room.  There may be long term benefits that are difficult to align and need time to be firmed up, multinational/multiorg shenanigans are difficult to wrangle, like herding grumpy cats.  And very much also consider that some of these brokers, their entire livelihood depends on shaving points on brokering any deal.

Wizards works in, fundamentally, a partnership with the LGS that sell its product, run its tournaments and provide spaces for casual players to get together (and for less casual players to test in). Wizards also has to try to retain as many players as possible. \\n Starting with the players side, there are a couple of classes of constructed player that are irrelevant to the discussion of costs. Purely kitchen table players don\\'t give a damn one way or another. For the most part if a card is too expensive they won\\'t play it, nor will anyone in their group and, more importantly, many of those cards aren\\'t ones they\\'d particularly enjoy playing anyway. On the complete opposite side of the spectrum, true pros (kbller, lsv, pvddr, nakamura etc.) don\\'t give a damn because they will play a card regardless of it\\'s cost and likely never have to pay anything for it. So leaving aside those groups you have speculators, fnmers and semi pros (aka grinders). \\n Speculators are obvious, start trashing the value of cards and they will get upset. There isn\\'t any way to make money on cards that drop in value in magic and therefore mass reprints of everything valuable would likely simply drive them away from the game. Fuck \\'em you say? Well they drive some of the trade in cards and a lot of the ways people get value for there cards is by trading with speculators but .  Alright . . .fuck \\'em then. Next category please, semi-pros. \\n Semi-pros really care about the value of cards. Trying to break into a format competitively is really expensive and semi-pros trying to improve a deck or get into a new format will sometimes be the ones you hear complaining. They\\'re also the group that left in droves when chronicles happened the first time and would likely abandon ship again if the reprints some of them asked for occurred. Why? Because for most of them (us) the only way we can stay competitive is the trade value of their (our) cards. Take standard, for example. Whenever a rotation occurs semi-pros need a way to mitigate costs so at they are not forced to buy a between half and a whole new deck from scratch. The way most of us do this is by careful trading (with speculators and stores) offloading cards that will lose value/liquidity through rotation for cards that will hold some value and tradability. Those cards are then traded off to build the next deck often covering much or all of the cost. That\\'s just a standard phenomenon you say? Even we\\'re that true it would be very bad as standard is the largest of the constructed formats as well as the one that gets most people into competitive play. That said, it\\'s not true. Modern decks don\\'t rotate but bans do occur and meta changes occur constantly. Staying competitive in modern requires fewer tweaks to a deck on average but it still needs some and trading, again, is how you avoid haveing to buy the new cards from scratch. Now you may be thinking \"but all the cards will be cheap!\" no... They won\\'t. Cards that are in standard that see legacy and modern play (that aren\\'t reprints) would be extremely expensive still unless wizards printed everything good at common/uncommon. If they did do that, limited would die overnight and, given that it\\'s a major seller of packs so too would most LGS and wizards (more on that later). \\n Fnmers. Aside from stores closing and fnm no longer existing, these are the people who might actually benefit. They care less, generally, about complete tier one decks but being able to play what the pros are play (or a variation thereof) in any format for cheap appeals to most fnmers and rightfully so. This is the single group who would actually gain from a mass reprint +printing of all good cards at low rarities. Well they would, except that stores won\\'t be running fnm anymore, and larger events won\\'t exist to strive for.  . .also wizards might go under. \\n Sound apocalyptic? Well it is, but here\\'s my argument. We should, by now, know that stores don\\'t make a ton of money off of sealed magic product. Multiple AMAs have said so, every store owner says so, basically this is fact. If there\\'s no value in the packs (because everything needed is common) people will buy fewer and the profit margin will go down further on them but that\\'s not actually the big problems. Those are as follows. First, stores make a lot of money selling singles. Used product generally being more profitable than new product and whatnot. Massive reprints= no more profit there plus the loss of a significant amount of value in their inventory. This would cause many stores to fold including some bigs ones like Scg, face to face, anyone you can think of that has a vendors table at a big event would fold, immediately as their inventory went from being worth thousands (and up) of dollars to tens or hundreds overnight. Worse, standard events would no longer draw many players cutting the business of those stores without large inventories. Limited events would also suffer as the value of the cards in packs would no longer be as high forcing limited players who rely on selling their winnings to mitigate the cost of play out of the game. Some comic shops that do magic as a side deal might survive but they wouldn\\'t likely be hosting magic events any more as the money would no longer be there. Big events like gps and Ptqs would drop drastically in terms of the number of players as semi-pros simply could no longer afford to stay current dropped out. wizards business model would be shot to hell and magic would likely die (albeit slowly as casual players would still play although no new sets would be released and the supply of cards  and new players would dry up). \\n On the plus side, you\\'d get cheap goyfs. \\n Edit: holy rant.', summary='mass reprints bad for everybody even the people who think they want them.

It worked immediately from the [Kubuntu]( 13.04 Live USB without additional drivers.  The Ubnuntu 13.04 Live USB worked as well, but I was having quite a bit of trouble with it being very slow; I suspect due to  limited support for Mir  [edit: Unity running crappy on the inbuilt] Intel graphics chip. \\n As this (like the Yoga) is a Windows 8 laptop, I had the same issues with having to disable Secure Boot and UEFI in the bios before I could install to the hard drive (or even run some of the Live USBs I tested). \\n Due to wanting to setup Xen Hypervisor, I wound up installing Ubuntu first, then Kubuntu desktop and KDM on top of that (sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop kdm) as there is apparently a bug causing an issue with installing Xen or LVM on Kubuntu that isn't there in Ubuntu for some reason..  When I first booted into Ubuntu after installing it, it wouldn't even boot all the way into Ubuntu so I had to get into shell to install (Ctrl+F2) Kubuntu and KDM (setting KDM as the default display manager).  After a reboot, I was able to get into the KDE Plasma desktop by selecting the dropdown for it from the login screen. \\n KDE:  KDE/Kubuntu works fairly well with the touchscreen though there are a few issues I'm currently trying to resolve.  There does not appear to be a way to set the mouse to do a right-click on a long-press as you can under Ubuntu which is my biggest issue.  There is also an issue with interacting with plasma widgets, including the Panel.  The first tap on a widget will move the mouse and activate a mouse-click as expected, but if you click on something other than the same plasma widget, the cursor will no longer click on plasma widgets when you tap on them.  The cursor will move and the Task Manager will act as if you're hovering on the widget allowing you to tap on the preview and bring a window to the the forefront or minimize it, but this is an odd quirk.  There is a bit of a workaround using the onscreen keyboard however (see below). \\n Touchscreen Keyboard:  There is a touchscreen capable keyboard already installed in Kubuntu called Onboard that you can have launch on login and will minimize to a small square icon that you can move anywhere on your screen and will stay on top of other programs (very nice!).  Onboard also includes mouse click control functions so that you can tap on the icon for right-click or double-click and your next tap on the touchscreen will be interpreted as such.  Far from ideal, but it works consistently.  I was  not able  to find a way to pull up an on-screen keyboard before login however.  A different display manager might include this functionality. \\n Multitouch:  Multitouch on the touchscreen was working and I was actually able to resize and twist some plasmids with it.  I cannot confirm that it detects more than 2 fingers, though the specs for my model say the screen can detect up to 5. \\n Gestures:  Not working out of the box and I do not have a solution at this time, though some of my searches have yielded some possibilities.  It's not been my priority though so I haven't tried much thus far, but I am hopeful since the screen does support multi-touch. \\n Screen Rotation:  Automatic screen rotation was not working out of the box.  Again, haven't looked too deeply but did notice some possible solutions while looking for fixes for other things. \\n Other Thoughts:  I have a personal preference towards KDE, but I believe that Ubuntu's Unity may be a better for Touchscreens.

       " Row(content='Saw elsewhere... Agreed mostly. Modified formatting for Reddit (which I suck at) \\n Extremely heavy tech article overall very positive for X1 - to immediately be followed up with downplay and fanboy nonsense unchanged from the last six months. Great :\\\\ \\n In case anyone can actually admit they aren\\'t a programmer, but still wants to know what this is all about, I\\'ll do my best to explain, briefly.... (I\\'m a low level hardware programmer, I don\\'t program for DirectX, all below is just my actually-educated take on it) \\n \\n DX12 is introducing a new way to program for GPUs. As code has become more complex the old way of programming is becoming less efficient. MS is estimating that in most games, frame to frame, about 90% of the code is the same. This makes perfect sense, engines do this naturally of course, even between same-engine games the majority of the rendering will look familiar. The Last Of Us code knows how to make a Last of Us frame, and that doesn\\'t change for the most part. DX12 is introducing \"bundles\" that highly optimize this process. \\n \\n Bundling code wouldn\\'t do much on it\\'s own though, besides making the code look easier to read and change for the dev (so like OpenGL\\'s version of bundles, there is a benefit in usability). So the cool part is that MS/DX12 has devised a way to use the CPU to auto-optimize the time, the order, the priority, where the results are stored, and how to que up the next instruction. This is CPU heavy. It\\'s using the CPU to allow the GPU to run at a higher efficiency. \\n \\n Ok, but the CPU is a finite resource too! You can\\'t just fall back on the CPU to help keep the GPU fed and churning along, it\\'s not like the CPU is just sitting idle. So... Another aspect of DX12 is that it\\'s designed to not only reduce the overhead on the CPU (see Mantle), but it\\'s being implemented as way to improve the parallelism of all the cores (see the DX12 launch slides where one CPU core is always loaded far higher than the rest, much more equally loaded after DX12). By reducing the dependance on the core assigned to the \"main game loop\" which runs at 1.75/1.6Ghz X1/PS4 respectively, they are breaking the load down across all available game cores. This increased ability to push parallel tasks means a huge increase in effective CPU throughput. This is why we even have multiple CPU cores of course. DX12 allows for benefit from them. \\n \\n So now DX12 is helping load the GPU at the cost of CPU while taking that new CPU load and spreading out across cores (see article and slides above). But... DX12 is also adding new rendering techniques like the previous versions of DirectX. So, the new effects that came with DX9, 10, 11... There are new versions for 12 as well. These have not yet been detailed. What remains to be seen is if they are just updated versions of 11.2/existing hardware functions (hardware tiling, etc) or if MS included the new DX12 hardware in the X1 SoC. They were developing the two concurrently for the past 5 years... So it\\'s very likely to me they would have included them together. No guarantee. \\n \\n DX12 is also doing something cool with ram management. By loading the CPU heavy with GPU efficiency tasks, the CPU is now keeping track of the CPU and the GPU\\'s memory requirements. So it\\'s the ideal time to schedule/execute tasks and move memory around. Something that often gets REALLY misconstrued is the \"ONLY\" 32mb of ESRAM the X1 has. DX12 is being shown to have the ability to dynamically move data on a predictive nature based on... bundles. What they are saying is that the system and dev will be able to make sure the right memory is where it needs to be when it needs to be. For this, the X1 would utilize the \"Move Engines\" / DMA controllers so that the CPU and GPU both while busy doing tasks, the DMA is loading and unloading from system ram and ESRAM all the time. It doesn\\'t matter that you have a 32mb plate and want to eat an elephant, you do it the same way everytime - you eat it one bite (byte, heh) at a time. \\n \\n In reply to the author\\'s notes and like minded to another poster here... Remember all that CPU loading DX12 is now doing? Remember that the X1 has a slightly faster processor than other consoles? What else helps with CPU utilization? Cloud offloading (see Titanfall\\'s AI). If you have a system that you know is going to load the CPU very heavily in order to massively improve efficiency on the GPU... You try and off load things like map generation, AI, NPCs, physics, and whatever else you can to the network/cloud. Besides pulling load from the CPU, could compute could be a huge benefit for realism later on (see latest Cloud Compute building destruction physics example), and right now it\\'s just awesome for reduced lag. This is an interesting advantage for MS as they are the only console player currently with access to a network that can make this possible. \\n \\n \\n . \\n So... That should be about it. There is a WHOLE LOT of wait and see here. But what is for sure, is that this is a MAJOR shift in technology here (at the DX12 reveal AMD saying \"it\\'s like getting four generations are hardware ahead today\"). So while it MAY or MAY NOT \"double performance\" on X1. I think it\\'s clear it\\'s going to be a big deal. With next wave games like Wolfenstien and Sniper3 already 1080p on X1 just with more time over launch games, or better MS tools, or removed kinect/app/OS reservation (we really don\\'t know the answer to which) it seems to me, that DX12 will firmly cement 1080p for future X1 games (see Phil Spencer\\'s comments implying we\\'re in the 360-Perfect Dark Zero phase right now and not the 360-Halo4 stage). Now... Before the fanboys jump in with some propaganda that doesn\\'t work on anyone but the extreme base, does it really hurt you if X1 games are 1080p? No, it helps you. I fully expect PS4 games to remain 1080p as well. It\\'s not a competition.

As he himself pointed out, it is not a leap that can be made once and for all. It is a leap that has to go on and on being performed, in spite of mounting evidence to the contrary. This effort is actually too much for human minds, and leads to delusions and manias. Religion understands perfectly well that the leap is subject to sharply diminishing returns, which is why it often doesn\\'t in fact rely on faith at all but instead corrupts faith and insults reason by offering evidence and pointing to confected proofs. This evidence and these proofs include arguments from design, revelationd, punishments, and miracles. Now that religion\\'s monopoly has been broken, it is within the compass of any human to see these evidences and proofs as the feeble-minded inventions that they are. \\n But there is no mystery why many scientist feel that they must  pretend  that religion and science are compatible. We have recently emerged out of many centuries of religious bewilderment and persecution, into an age when mainstream science is still occasionally treated with overt hostility by the general public and even by governments. While few scientists living in the west now fear torture or death at the hands of religious fanatics, many will voice concerns about losing their funding if they give offense to religion, particularly in America. It also seems that given the relative poverty of science, wealthy organizations like the Templeton Foundation (1.5 billion endowment) have managed to convince some scientists and science journalists that it is wise to split the difference between intellectual integrity and the fantasies of a prior age. \\n >this shows your clear lack of undestanding... \\n Again when you cannot form a counter and demolish my argument you resort to petty name calling.

Gamer C wants to win using an unorthodox strategy, something that hasn\\'t been done before. He wants to \"break\" the game.\\n> \\n There is nothing stopping you from doing that in heroes. Just like in LoL, straying from the cookie cutter builds/top heroes/champions might reduce your chances of winning, but they don\\'t remove them entirely.  That doesn\\'t \"break\" the game imo; it\\'s just innovating, which happens all the time in every MoBA until the game is pretty much entirely figured out. \\n Thanks for the clarification though; I thought you meant finding some way to be overpowered because of some undiscovered synergy between a hero and a particular item. \\n >While you say that talents change a hero as much as items (in lol), since the base hero is simpler, i\\'d say the end result is less ability to diversify.\\n> \\n Talents change a hero more than items in LoL; some of them change the functionaility and primary uses of certain abilities, which adds more diversity; not less. The \"diversity\" you can get with items is negligible, because most characters are forced into particular builds (order of itemization only changes for particular match-ups and for people building defensive items), with a few choice items (like Static Shiv vs Phantom Dancers or BT vs BoRK) if they want to be competitive. It should actually be easier to make multiple viable talent builds than it would be to make multiple viable item builds in other games, which adds complexity/depth to the game, not detract from it. \\n What makes the heroes simpler? \\n The removal of MR and armor? There are talents in HoTS (Spellshield, block), that effectively replace that, and with talents being individualized, there aren\\'t cookie cutter builds that work on every hero of a particular role. \\n Not choosing what skill to rank up at each level? Generally speaking, what skill you rank up first is decided before the game even starts because most heroes/champions are almost required to max ability X first and ability Y second. In HoTS, you get to pick between 2 completely different ultimates, which, in an ideal environment are equally viable, and what ultimate is chosen affects everyone\\'s approach to the game. \\n Or do you just mean those characters that have tons of stuff in their kits (like Thresh and Lee sin in LoL)? Most of those characters cause serious problems with balancing, and often end up in situations where they are insanely powerful and near impossible to balance because they have a ton of utility, or are impossible to balance because of the need to rank up skills as you level. Lee sin and Elise have 2 damage abilities in 1; to equalize their late game with other characters, each of those abilities would need to be similar in strength to an individual damage ability on another character, but that makes then insanely overpowered in the early-mid game. This forces them to choose between either giving the character in question an overpowered early game, or a weak late game. Heroes can do the same thing by changing how damage and health scale relative to base values, and what talents a particular hero has at what stage in the game, but they are never forced into that decision because of hero design reasons. \\n A hero with no mobility skills or CC is just as complex to play as a character with 3 of them. A character with significant limitations on what they can do (having only 1 CC or mobility skill) is often MORE complex to play than someone who doesn\\'t have significant limitations (see Raynor vs Tychus/Valla, or Twitch vs almost any other ADC in LoL; kit is \"simple\" but playing the character is strategically more difficult). \\n Overall, the strategy in HoTS isn\\'t any less complex than any other game. \\n Until X happens/spawns, soak/farm lanes with more importance placed on not dying than on getting kills.

Flying with the mouse doesn't get you easy access to the most complicated acrobatics, but it does make everything a joystick user has to learn into a joke. \\n If you're the type to really enjoy the engaging nature of a joystick in a flight game, and find the mouse-based autopilot to be boring and un-fun, either stick it out in RB until you've got the required planes for SB, or give up and play IL-2. Or give up trying to have fun and join the plebeian mass of mouse aim devotees. \\n The meta in RB revolves around one thing, with an honorable mention for another. \\n That one thing is vertical performance. Performance climbs, prop hangs, and zoom climbs. The game format (mutual airfield starts or extreme distance air starts beyond visual range) has always given the big advantage to interceptors that can fly to space in the safety of invisibility and just repeatedly dive on their foes with impunity.

It's what the community apparently wants to do, because every time someone suggests an alternative the armchair air marshals shit on them with nonsense like 'it's strategic'. \\n That other thing the meta sort of depends on is visibility. The game right now features a really absurd and shitty system for rending planes at medium to long ranges. At medium ranges the anti aliasing will blend nearby aircraft into the ground, even though they are in motion and our eyes are actually really fucking good at picking out those kinds of things against far off backgrounds.

       " Row(content=\"The Dominion meta focuses around speed and big damage. Because of the latter, having durability is also a trait looked for in many champions. \\n In Dominion, champions snowball very quickly. The increase in gold and exp gain means that hyper-carries reach their late-game status much faster than in SR, and it also means that shutting them down is that much more of a none option. Considering that most points will be under one side or the others control for most of the game, there are more options for minions to farm if someone wants that extra gold, plus the normal benefits of killing an enemy champion and the gold benefits of capping points. \\n All this leads to a situation where champs that provide absurd amounts of damage tend to be favoured. I can't tell you the amount of times that my team has been losing early game, only for us to hit 12-13 minutes and suddenly every fight goes our way. You're ALWAYS levelling up, you're ALWAYS gaining heaps of gold, so there's no reason not to play champs that rely on farm, because not only are you literally getting free farm, but if you really want some extra gold, it's not hard to get it at all. \\n Speed is another hugely important aspect in Dominion's meta. Yes, the speed shrines are there, but those are not always the best way to get where you're going, especially if the enemy team is nowhere to be seen. The inability to buy wards means that you have to pay close attention to the vision ring and the central buff location (so many players don't realise that walking through there reveals your intentions). If you're purple and the enemy team is going on a hard up angle from Quarry, you can anticipate where they are heading. Having speed and mobility allows you to get where you want to go, faster, and safer. Faster champions also allow the faster capping of those initial points, which means minions further down the lane. In SR, that's a bad thing, but in Dominion that means more pressure on your opponents, and if you can farm a few waves of the enemies minions, the enemy team has to deal with the pressure the minions put on their tower. Don't underestimate minion tower aggression, they neut and cap towers FAST. \\n So with the huge damage meta, survivability becomes quite important. Interestingly, GA is not as common as you'd expect. Of course, team fights in Dominion tend to be over by the time GA will bring you back to life, and the minimal amount it restores means you're probably going to go down again quickly anyway. Life-steal is big, as are resistances and health, but this is where speed comes into play. Greater speed and mobility allows for better positioning, and avoidance of poor situations (plus you'll get to health relics faster). \\n All this being said, because of the relatively small penalties for dying (low respawn timer, doesn't deny you EXP or gold as heavily), you can be more risky with your plays and if you have to die to secure a cap point long enough for your team to arrive, it's not that bad. \\n For these reasons, AD carries and hypercarries are very popular. AP carries tend to be more bursty but have longer cooldowns. Yes, you can get to shorter cooldowns faster because of the free-farm, but the fast pace of Dominion is not conducive to long CD abilities. Aggression is easy, there's a lot of ways to approach cap points and if you're supported by a friend it's possible to neut a point, thereby forcing your opponent to split his focus between fighting you and making sure the point isn't getting neutralised. So champs with high attack speed, high damage and/or low cooldowns tend to dominate. \\n Duelist champions also have a stronger place in the meta, because of the frequency with which a fight is 1v1 (or 2v1 and a tower). Fiora for example, isn't that great in SR but has very strong play in Dominion. She gets a lot of mobility and excels because of her typical life-steal builds. Riven is another champ who does nicely, because her mobility is fantastic and the speed with which she can get AD items simply improves her survivability even more (<3 E). \\n On the flipside, some champions require a different playstyle from SR to be as effective. Morgana's long cooldowns mean she's not as good in Dominion as in SR, but with early maxxed CDR and good positioning, she is very strong in teamfights. However, choosing when to pop her ult is more difficult because teamfights happen more frequently, and holding off in one fight to use in the next (when you wouldn't have it available if you popped it earlier) can easily mean the difference between a win and a loss. Of course, she also brings her usual pushability to Dominion, which means she can pressure other points very easily. \\n Now, all of this being said (:P) supports are still viable in Dominion, some more so than others. Highly disruptive supports can win teamfights, but it's important to realise that you will start getting shredded very quickly towards late-game. Thus supports whose primary focus is tanking the enemy to prevent damage on team-mates are less useful because they bring far less control to the fight. Supports who disrupt and can do so regularly can be very helpful. Take Leona, for example. Her abilities are on such short cooldowns with the right itemisation that she is an enormously disruptive presence and her W allows her to be that tanky disruptive presence in a Dominion teamfight. Alistar, whose abilities can get nicely short cooldowns, is another disruptive champion who can really cause havoc for the opposing team.

A correlation is not a causation.  Without a randomized, blinded, placebo controlled trial, we really can't make any statements about whether fluoridation causes any changes in IQ.  There could be a number of other factors, such as socio-economic status, which confound the link between fluoridation and IQ. \\n More specifically on the paper you're referencing, a couple of issues make me question their findings: \\n \\n Look at Table 1, which lists the aggregated studies.  How do they define 'high fluoride exposure'?  The concentrations range from 0.6mg/L (Xiang 2006) to 11mg/L (Yao 1996).  What about the reference concentrations?  They range from 0.2mg/L (Xiang 2006) to 2.4mg/L (Fan 2007).  Note the overlap?

Years ago, even the central processing unit (CPU) in a computer was composed of many separate chips that performed different functions (cache, ALU, multipliers, floating point, etc.). As chip geometries got smaller (the feature size in nanometers decreased), more transistors fit on a given amount of silicon, and the number of features in a given 'chip' increased. In the personal computing space, which you're probably most familiar with, the CPU in a computer became a single chip (a 'microprocessor') first. Over the years, engineers have incorporated multiple caches, the memory controller (so DRAM is now connected directly to the processor) and increasing amounts of the chipset (the 'north bridge' more recently). Reducing the number of individual chips needed can reduce costs and power consumption, increase performance, etc. AMD's APUs (and Intel's more recent chips like its latest 'Haswell' processor) go an extra step and incorporate a graphics processing unit (itself composed of multiple small cpu 'cores') directly into what everyone's just been calling the 'cpu.'

Evangelion is just a bunch of depressed people slowly falling apart. No one wants to dwell on sadness too long. That just leads to cynicism. But do not mistake cynicism for realism. There are those that think the world is nothing but a cycle of sadness and hatred. They are not wrong it is that they lack the ability to see hope. The characters in Evangelion saw the world through inverted rose-tinted glasses. They didn\\'t see the world for what it was, they just saw what they wanted to see and believed that\\'s what the world was. \\n This is why I don\\'t understand the hate for 3.0. 3.0 is exactly like the end of the series all over again, almost note for note.

My S2 elo was hovering around 1650, and after a decent hiatus it dropped down to the lower 1400s with a placement in silver I before dropping down to silver II. At the time I was mainly concentrating on my 5 v 5 team so I ignored solo q for the most part, focusing on my support role on my team. I kept playing the same supports in my 5 v 5 team in solo q and it really didn't work out too well for me. I had forgotten how to solo q proficiently. \\n Actual Advice Begins Here*: You seem to be worrying about way too many things at once. Not even two weeks ago I said to myself that I'd play solo q like the old days, it didn't matter that I hadn't played those roles in so long, back when I was at my old elo I played enough of my small pool of specialized champions to memorize their approximate damage values and strengths. \\n Silver is very much about exploiting small openings, but otherwise playing the safe game. Always farm, always ward, always keep a line of communication. Most players know how to play the cookie cutter game in the event that everything stays even. If you aim to play the tightest game you can play you'll improve at a steady rate, and I think you are improving at this rate without realizing it. Now, in my situation I had a few trump cards in the form of my old champions, swain, nami, and renekton. I would go ahead and go through all your champions to isolate 2-3 of your best in your main roles and keep learning all of their intricacies and matchups. Not exactly being strictly part of the current meta is perfectly alright, but you have to be confident that they are your best champions performance wise, or champions that you know can come very close to singlehandedly ending the game if they get fed.\", summary=\"You're probably already improving at a steady pace if you keep playing with an improvement mindset, but if you want to fasttrack your progress think hard about finding some mains that really resonate well with you and your playstyle.\", author='ZeroRacer', subreddit='summonerschool', tickers=['META'], sentiment=0.0),\n",

I must say the analogy is quite flawed in a few aspects. \\n First off, and the most obvious to me as a Pokemon player: balance in mons works perfectly fine at lower rating brackets. So does stall. In fact in Gen 4 a lot of the most successful ladder-grinding teams were in fact surprise: stall! In fact, stall was initially  created  to give you a more stable ladder experience and reduce variance in the long run, while the enemy outplays himself. Not convinced? Look at GSC - heavily centralized around a few threats, if you wandered out of the 20~ most played mons list without 100% knowing what you were doing, you simply got crushed. If you wanted to play against people who were clueless, what better way to crush them than stall? While there are underused gimmicks around, they were not hard to beat. Stall can also give immunity to idiot effect. If you say pure gimmicks and surprise factor win against stall, tell me more about how Electivire is so good at breaking stall XD. At the current meta of hearthstone, there\\'s very little variation. You see the class. Then you know it\\'s either or of the 2 archetypes. Or less if they\\'re a shaman. Past turn 2 where you can tell apart the archetype, basically every card you see is never a surprise. Lack of diversity strongly favors slow, controlled games. Control should flourish in such environment with little surprise factors. Then why offense in Hearthstone? \\n CCG lacks the eventuality and inevitability that is implied in Pokemon.  If you\\'re going to win against me, you should have something that can get past my Suicune. If nothing in your roster can 3-shot my RestTalk Cune, nor is immune to Water, doesn\\'t really matter how well you play - you\\'re fucked. My answer to whatever the heck you\\'re going to do is in my hand ready to be sent out, and there\\'s really no way you\\'re preventing me from sending Swampert into your Rotom bar trapping abilities.  My \"right answer\" is always in my hand, ready for use.  Not so in card games. In card games, I might not draw my Druid of the Claw. I might not get far enough to play that card with a steep mana cost. This in itself creates and environment where \"midrange\" decks, or balanced teams runs rampant in Pokemon, but this clearly fails us in CCGs. I can see what you think about how aggro reduces variation, but offense teams can be equally screwed over by something dumb like Scarf Azelf or something completely that you didn\\'t expect to be scarfed because they already have another scarfer. Or your Gengar goes down to Sucker Punch Celebi. Or your Shell Smash Omastar gets one-shotted by an energy ball Jellicent.

So that makes it difficult for 'normal' people to write genius or savant characters. Myself, I'm 'gifted', which is the level below genius.\\nI don't feel like I'm different to other people. Sure, I'm generally smarter than most people I meet, but it's not like I really operate on an incredible high level of intellect. \\n True genii and savants  are  a class above regular people, but it's generally an individual basis. There are some genii/savants that you'd meet and never know it; some are very strongly bent towards one way or the other. There's a whole slew of psychological terms that can describe these individual levels. \\n As for whether the characters work, I think it depends. \\n Obviously, Sherlock Holmes without a genius detective to battle against the mentally unhinged or dastardly villain, wouldn't be the same. In particular, it's an issue with mystery or crime shows/media. The audience wants to feel confused themselves, otherwise if the audience could solve the mystery within five minutes, then why do we need the smart detective? So the shows are layered with multiple misdirections and loopsbacks that the viewer/reader is bamboozled, and then right at the end, there's a magic moment of revelation where that guy's shoe size perfectly matches the one random boot print, and a tiny speck of blood on a sock means that the guy was actually the murderer. \\n In fact, there's nothing genius about the leading character - it's purely that the plot and writing is so twisted about itself, that the  only  logical solution to how the mess was solved, is that the detective can see 'missing pieces'. This is further exemplified by having the 'reveal' at the end of the show, where the detective deliberately explains it all in order, oftentimes to his 'dumber' partner or 'very dumb' station chief (who's probably dirty, because, well, it makes for a cool season finale). \\n Some shows/media do this worse than others. I won't name specific shows, as it's largely personal taste, but some just leave me wondering  How is that even possible? .  I  will  say that  Castle  is probably one of the  best  crime shows, simply because  neither  main characters are genii. Castle himself is a crime writer, so he does have a leg-up on some cases, but the show never makes you feel as though there were invisible dots connected to get to the end. \\n Outside of crime shows, genii tend to be overbearing and overplayed, often obnoxious and annoying (but almost always right in the end). It's a massive cliche, but it doesn't seem like there's any other way of writing one of these characters. How do you make Spock  not  an asshole? His character is written like that because he's an unemotional genius - but here's the kicker. He's written to be an asshole, because his  fellow crew are humans . Ie, his personality is written for our (the audience) to feel stupid, or at least feel like the crew are stupid, and that's why Spock is an asshole, because he's so much smarter than them all. \\n Even comedy -  Big Bang Theory , for instance, plays Sheldon Cooper as an arrogant and sometimes downright ignorant bully, making it tough for the audience to ever sympathize with him. In fact, most of the show's humor is based on the other characters' reactions to his over-the-top personality. Although I'm sure there are some genii with that personality type, I think it's cliched deliberately for the show. \\n Then there's the supervillain. The  evil genius . Strangely enough, supervillains are only ever written one way - that despite their overall massive intellect and evil capability, they overlook some simple brute-force/regular-person thing that eventually unravels their entire carefully orchestrated plot, because, fuck it, Bruce Willis is just going to kick the front door down and shoot you in the face. Hah. Never thought of that, did you evil villain?  The super villain is written so that the audience grows to hate him, then applauds when the 'regular guy' manages to take him down a peg or two, so the audience feels good about themselves. \\n As for advice? Well, I'm a writer (not yet published, but close enough), so I can offer my own penny or two on the subject. \\n I think  moderation  is the key point here. Stop trying to make genii such strong personalities. Treat them like you would any other character; in that they  have their entrance and their exit . \\n In that, I mean that the genius has something he's really good at, but he has his weakness too - and don't make that 'weakness' his inability to communicate with people. Seriously, that's getting more trope'd than the supervillain. I think genii need to be used carefully, as tools, but also like any other part of the overall character pool. For crime/mystery, they need to be balanced out,  sharing  their on-screen/scene time with another, equally strong character. Or, in other words, make the genii  less  strong, and make the 'supporting' character more critical to the overall plot.  Don't let the entire book/show ride along the back of your one genius.\", summary=\"Yes, genii get way overplayed in books and T.V. shows, as a method of obfuscating mystery murders and then allowing the writers a legitimate method of piecing it all together again (because Sherlock noticed that stray feather on your collar).

In the later stages of the game Osiris should move from the front line to a little farther back with your mages and adc to try and assist them in boxing matches with enemy players. \\n Osiris\\' main strength lies in his damage mitigation, allowing him to out damage almost anyone he boxes with, which makes an early Hide of the Urchin insanely beneficial to him.

It\\'s a somewhat subtle meta-commentary on the nature of current teen-horror slashers and torture porn in Hollywood. It combines elements from a number of sub-genres of horror, and comedy. \\n If you are one of those people that completely avoid the kind of movies cabin is trying to make fun of, a lot of the movie\\'s humor will be completely lost; or just be an exercise in preaching to the choir. \\n Here\\'s the plot synopsis: \\n 1) A group of organized cthulu-ian cultists organize ritualistic killings to appease old gods. These killings happen by using actual monsters. They are broadcast to an audience that isn\\'t really shown. The victims aren\\'t supposed to know what\\'s really going on, or defeat the monsters. It\\'s something like a reality TV show where killings  actually  happen.\\nAt the office of the people orchestrating all this, we see a complete disregard for the victim\\'s lives, and an almost sadistic form of entertainment playing out, where they take bets on various nuances of the slaughter. \\n 2) A group of teenagers go on a trip to a cabin, and become victims of the above ritualistic slaughter. They are puppeteered into acting out conventional horror stereotypes (the virgin, the slut, the jock, the nerd, and the joker). A lot of this conditioning into these tropes happens through chemicals/pheromones and early on the film hints that the characters have normal non-stereotypical personalities \\n One of the biggest problems I had personally with the horror elements of this film was the lack of suspense. Very early on in the movie; in fact; right at the beginning we see cave paintings of sacrifices. Then at regular intervals we actually see the \"puppeteers\" so we, the audience, constantly know what is going to happen. We then see the megadome that houses this reality TV torture chamber/cabin the moment the RV enters the valley - we see an invisible polygon dome like thing. Then soon after, we see an interrogation room screen. Anyway the problem with all this is it really takes away from the fear of the unknown and the very fabric of the suspense. Imagine if you were watching psycho and someone spoilt it for you. The effect just isn\\'t the same once you know what and why things are going to happen. \\n Although the film in its own subtle way is parodying teen slashers, the first hour of the film is exactly that. We don\\'t see a zombie tripping or falling or monsters behaving in an unconventionally funny way, nor is there any \"humor\" as such. What we do see though, is a lot of references of B-grade horror film tropes and some stoner humor. \\n Pop culture references can indeed be an excellent tool in comedy. Community does this really well; and one of the things Abed does is meta-humor and acting out references to older films. But this is just one aspect of Community. Abed’s skits are sometimes genius, but sometimes completely missed. Imagine if you took one of those hit or miss skits, and stretched it over a full movie. That\\'s exactly what cabin is like. \\n There\\'s always a metaphorical layer to everything that\\'s going on - for example the old gods are actually the audience of B-grade horror, that\\'s demanding more. The world ending is signifying that horror movies need to move away from these clichés. Having all the monsters exit from the elevator signifies that they are tropes that should not be further done to death. \\n If you are a fan of quirky, more random off-beat humor; you will appreciate some of the aspects of this film. Absurdity is often used as a mechanic; for example there\\'s a scene where a unicorn skewers one of the evil SWAT guards of the cult. No one expects a positive creature to be shown in a negative light as a monster. Drag me to Hell did this with a talking goat. But this kind of thing is really hit or miss. \\n If you go in expecting a genuinely scary movie, or unsettling horror, you\\'ll be disappointed. Similarly if you go in expecting uproarious comedy horror like Evil Dead, Shawn of the Dead; or more slapsticky stuff like Scream, you won\\'t be amused at all. \\n One of the worst things about this kind of genre deconstruction/parody is that the movie is constantly self-aware and laughing at itself. Sadly the audience is often just left in the lurch puzzled what the fuss is all about. \\n Something else that really bugs me is the lack of sincerity in the parodying of the slasher sub-genre. There\\'s a certain hypocrisy in the execution. Is the movie a scathingly sharp satire of the genre? Or is it a tribute? The film-makers can\\'t really figure this out (they even call it a \"loving hate letter\"). Why not come clean and deliver a sharp critical satire of a sub-genre that obviously sucks? What\\'s holding them back?

All other hardware connects to the motherboard, so your limits are based on what the motherboard is capable of. \\n RAM : Get DDR3, I guarantee your motherboard will support DDR3, if it doesn\\'t then pick a motherboard that does. 8 gigabytes (GB) is a good amount for gaming. Pay attention to the speed (1333/1600/1866 etc) and check what your motherboard is capable of. Make sure each of your RAM sticks are exactly the same ala  don\\'t mix and match RAM sticks. \\n Video Card : ATI and nVidia are both good. Most recently, ATI has been doing a good job of staying on par with performance of nVidia cards. If you get an ATI card, look at the number of the card. Go for a 6xxx or 7xxx series (7xxx is most recent, 8xxx coming this winter I believe). For the next number in the series, look for x7xx and up. x7xx is high-mid-end, x8xx is mid-high-end, x9xx is high-end, if that makes sense. The third digit in the sequence is almost always xx50, xx70, xx90; this is slightly less important. nVidia numbering works very similarly but with 3 digits. At minimum I recommend ATI HD 7770 or nVidia GTX 560 or 560ti. \\n Hard Drive/SSD : Okay, for a first time build I wouldn\\'t bother with RAID setups so forget about that. An SSD is a nice luxury but not necessary. I would recommend one large and moderately fast hard drive. Western Digital is IMO the best company for hard drives, they have always been the most reliable for me compared to other companies. 1 terabyte (TB) drives are pretty cheap now, I would recommend a 1TB if you are going to be installing lots of games. Look for a cache of at least 32MB, and a spin rate of 7200 RPM. \\n PSU : for your build, a 650 watt poser supply is probably enough, you can do more if you want. Go with a well known company for quality and longevity, like Thermaltake, Cooler Master, Corsair. Make sure its main power and CPU power connectors have the correct amount of pins to match up with your motherboard. Modular power supplies are the way to go, oh and it helps to get one with a switch on the back for so you don\\'t have to yank the cord when your PC stops responding. \\n CPU Cooling : Stock CPU coolers are fine unless you have a case that isn\\'t good with heat dissipation, or your computer is in a hot room, or you want to overclock. If you do get an aftermarket cooler, air is more than adequate. Don\\'t worry about water cooling for a first build. You can get some good air coolers for pretty cheap. Cooler Master, Thermaltake, Noctua are leading names in this category. \\n Case : make sure it fits all of your components. That\\'s the main point. A reset button is very handy too, most cases have reset buttons but some good ones do not. The only thing really necessary for a front panel is (to me) is USB ports. Also, look for a case with good airflow, that means at least a few fans or open vents. \\n Optical Drive : This can be internal (goes in one of your 5.25\" drive bays) or external (typically connected with two USB plugs if it\\'s a compact/slim drive). I ended up going with an external Blu-ray burner for my recent build. An internal drive will cost more and isn\\'t really necessary anymore, with most information sharing happening through networking and the Internet. I only connect my drive when I want to watch a Blu-ray, burn data discs, or look at old CDs. Regardless of what you get, I recommend it is capable of  reading and writing  CDs and DVDs. Almost all game discs are DVDs these days, CDs are only still used for music really. The ability to burn to discs is crucial for backing up information on discrete storage discs rather than on a network or separate hard drive/partition. Blu-ray (BD) reading/writing is nice but not necessary, and it jacks the price up a bit. Lightscribe is also nice but not necessary. \\n OS : This is one some people could easily overlook. Your hard drive won\\'t come with the operating system installed. You need to buy a copy of Windows if you don\\'t have one already.  Make sure it is 64-bit; 32-bit is limited to 3GB of RAM which is puny by today\\'s standards.  I recommend Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit at minimum. And get the OEM version, it\\'s way cheaper and it\\'s all you need. \\n Other peripherals : If you have decent monitors, speakers, keyboards, mice, reuse them. Don\\'t worry about buying new external components yet (unless you still use a CRT monitor).', summary=\"Look into protips on first-time PC building, biggest thing to be mindful of is compatibility between each part.

       " Row(content='I get what you\\'re saying, and it\\'s definitely still the dominant mindset in the industry, but I really just can\\'t get behind it. \\n Branding is essentially just an extension of heuristics. The brand becomes a metaphor trigger for the brand attributes. But those attributes are becoming less successfully defined by the marketer. \\n Take for instance Insurance companies. Pre-Internet age, Allstate could have the president from 24 with a warm soothing voice, I could talk with my friends (who likely never needed to submit a claim) about their experience with Allstate, and thought, wow, what a warm and helpful company.

ELO hell for me was Silver. \\n | \\n There is an annoying amount of people in this thread who think the OP  is full of shit because they have 2 accounts that are gold III and they had no problem carrying in Silver I. Some points to consider: \\n \\n Once OP was out of Silver he got to plat, once I left Silver I shot up to Gold I in a few days. It seems like after breaking out of Silver it becomes easier to carry. So if you personally carried past Silver, even multiple times, that means nothing because statistically one team wins each game, if you are on that team you go up. If you are not below your teams skill level you have at least a 50% chance of winning. In ten games 1 in 1024 people like you will win every game by sheer odds. Some people got lucky shooting up past Silver. Once your past Silver you aren't going to drop back down. \\n \\n In Silver the biggest problem is one player getting absolutely dominated, not because his lane opponent is better but because he is worse. I'll handily beat your average Silver player in lane, infact I almost always won lane. However I will only occasionally  cream  a Silver player. Going 8 3 9 is from being better than your lane opponent. Going 17 0 15 is from your lane opponent sucking balls or getting counter picked. For the most part I'll win my lane 8 3 9 but another lane will go 17 0 15, the team with that guy wins, the team with the 0 17 2 loses, regardless of the other lanes. \\n \\n So be that guy? I'm not Diamond I, I can't absolutely dominate a player to that extent in every game, if the player has a good pick and is scared shitless I'll mostly only reasonably dominate him. \\n \\n A gold one player knows how to ward, and when to do dragon and how to focus objectives properly, none of these things is possible without your team. Not doing these things will hinder a Gold I team, knowing about them will not help a Silver I team if they won't help you. \\n \\n Certain roles and play styles lend themselves to carrying. An excellent jungler or roaming mid does better than a support or farmey top for carrying. A good support can't carry a bad adc.

I still see people buying JCP. People still think they are going to turn the business market around; just look at the credit market. There are some extremely optimistic reports on the fixed income side. I still see people trying to buy JCP on every dip. People were buying from 12-14.

What I mean by that is that if a stock continues to make new highs, new highs, new highs and everyone is bearish. You can get bullish. Price action is saying the bears are wrong (see TSLA for this). \\n If, you are dead-set on investing in JCP and you don\\'t care about valuation because you think that it\\'s overextended to the downside and you truly believe that it is going higher from here, there are a few different ways I would play it. \\n First: Sell puts on big red days. When a stock is trading near 52wk lows and puts in 8% green days, there will be big red days. Identify short term levels of support (on hourly chart), and sell puts monthly. If you are assigned stock, good, you wanted to get long anyways. This just gives you a better cost basis than buying straight common. If you don\\'t get assigned: oh well, you made some money on the premium. Sell some more next month. \\n The second way I\\'d play is slightly more complicated. I\\'d buy a Jan 16 12/15 risk reversal: This means Sell 1x of the JAN16 12 CALLS and buy 2x of the 15 calls. I\\'d also sell 1x JAN16 3 PUT. Currently, you would collect about .30 on this trade. \\n Max Loss would be if JCP goes bankrupt, you\\'d be buying at $3 (which if you\\'re buying here would have happened anyways, but you\\'d lose half as much). The next biggest loss would occur if JCP closes at Jan16 expiration at 14.99. \\n For some numbers. If you did this trade with one contract. You\\'d collect 30$. If JCP went to zero, you\\'d lose $300 (100 shares @ $3) minus the $30 you collected: Max Loss $270. Next biggest loss would be about $145 loss if it closes between $14-15. However, if it trades there before expiration, you should be able to close the trade for a profit of between $170-$400 depending on how long it takes to get there. Plug the trade into an option analytic software and just experiment around. \\n Most likely outcome to both of those trades (or even buying JCP common here): You tie up your money for two years and make less than 5%.

Things like cities, temples etc. I worked on one such dig for a summer and it is a very slow, laborious process. \\n Sites are discovered by doing research on an area of interest, as well as doing survey work to find exact locations. The actual process of digging a site varies from region to region and director to director. But ultimately it involves digging square units into the site, stopping at arbitrary depths, recording every little detail (soil colour, consistency, slope, etc.) And putting all the dirt moved through a sieve (though we call it a screen). Artefacts are then recovered from the screen and sorted, labelled, drawn. \\n CRM is a bit different. Here, we do these things to make money. Basically the government (both Canada and the US) has laws in place that require archaeological assessment on any kind of proposed major construction. So archaeology companies are contracted out to perform those assessments. Each assessment can have 4 stages \\n 1 Is an initial background research of the area in question. Check archives, historical records, etc to see if you can get an idea of what used to be there. \\n 2 Survey. We go out and dig test pits or walked plowed farmers fields to see if anything turns up. If nothing, we're done. If we find something, we go to stage 3. \\n 3 At stage 3 we dig 1x1m squares at 5m intervals across the site and screen all the dirt to see if any artefacts pop up. If a significant amount do we escalate to stage 4. \\n 4 Basically we dig out the entire study area in 1x1m squares, screening all the dirt as we go. \\n So that's a very, very basic overview of how we get artefacts from the ground and into museums and the like.

I want to address some of the points you\\'ve brought up because many of them have been brought up before. \\n > At first I figured it was just because they didn\\'t have the same size player base that League of Legends did, but I quickly realized it was much more than that. \\n To most people, league has always been toxic. But for someone like me, who has been playing consistently since beta, its not hard to notice the change over time and the factors that correlate with the changes. \\n Here is a comment . The fact that LoL is the #1 streamed game of all time coupled with the \"Free to play\" looks like a formula for dirtying the playground to me. \\n How can streaming be a bad thing? People like to see pros win and try to emulate them. It gives people (who don\\'t understand the game in the first place)  an easy way to separate black from white . This build is WRONG or this champion is TRASH. When their expectations (stream) don\\'t meet reality (game) they lash out. These people are less likely to care about the integrity of their account or their reputation because LoL might be a thing they\\'re \"trying out\" or something they just do sometimes. The kids who seldom visit the playground are less concerned about dirtying it. \\n They also feel justified about bashing others because they\\'re playing the game \"correctly\" AKA what they saw on stream. This is where the idea of meta sheep comes from. Players, like me, who play the game organically, to experiment and experience a variety of playstyles, are labelled as trolls and shunned. \\n > Clearly, nobody is afraid of being reported, and I feel it\\'s because Tribunal is a flawed system \\n I actually agree with this. The tribunal is not a perfect system but  it would be remiss to ignore the good it has done.  From what I have seen, the Tribunal has been an utter success in lowering the degree of toxicity if not the frequency. [Here is a comment]( I wrote on this subject. The OP here is arguing that today\\'s community doesn\\'t know what an intentional feeder is because they don\\'t exist in the same abundance as they used to. But didn\\'t I just say that beta was a \"clean\" playground? How can this contradiction be true? \\n There is a major difference between the flavor of toxicity that exists today and the toxicity that the Tribunal got rid of. The difference is that  today\\'s toxicity tends to be incidental, while previously it was blatant and intentional.  Even the example you gave of your friend probably wouldn\\'t count as blatant toxicity in the old days. \\n For example, an old troll was actually very dedicated to his \"art\", this is where you see scores like 0/40. There were even guides written on how to feed in the most efficient way (teleport, mobi boots, zeals etc). Very few people would make an account, get it to 30, just to have it banned for trolling. Perhaps this is why you see more of these old style trolls in the very low level pool. Trolls today tend to be more subtle, passive-aggressive and turn to trolling because something angered or upset them. An old rager would be completely unrestrained; lets say someone dies and he blames you for it, today\\'s rager would probably spew some rage each time you do something \"wrong\". An old rager would proceed to spam the N-word in chat for the entirety of the rest of the game. \\n The problem here is not that the tribunal sucks or it doesn\\'t work.  Its that people have gotten better at toeing the line.  People will always do this, wherever there are rules, there are loopholes. Your friend, even though he seems unrestrained, probably knows that if he goes too far, he will be banned. Ragers can stagger their toxicity across many games, forcing a large error margin for tribunal hits. Riot do not prosecute these cases because they\\'ve received so much flak for false positives. Finally, premades reporting is a big problem and I completely agree with you on that point. \\n > Riot should have a Staff of GM that deal with these cases personally. \\n This is actually how it worked before the tribunal was created. I don\\'t have the figures on me, but even during S1 (when LoL playerbase was a  mere fraction  of what it is now) there were simply too many reports for a human to sort and adjudicate. The tribunal was a great idea to outsource this onto the community. \\n > I feel like players should have incentive to be helpful to their peers. \\n Riot\\'s stance on this topic tends to be that \"fake\" helpfulness is the result you get from giving players material incentives and that\\'s not what they want. This is shown by their removal of tribunal IP and their refusal to tie honor with rewards. I used to agree with this stance. But I\\'ve since realized how idealist it is. Once you reach a certain threshold,  \"fake\" manners are probably better than none at all. \\n > I don\\'t play much DotA, but from what I know, they have a sort of \"Low-Priority Queue\" \\n We have to ask whether we want to fix the problem or just be in a nice little gated community where the problem can be far away from us.  Low priority queue is a way to sweep the problem under the rug.  Players may not know why they are being punished or even that they are being punished at all. In both general society and video games, we want to reform people, not punish them and this \"prisoner\\'s island\" idea is a very \"out of sight, out of mind\" way to band-aid the problem. \\n I\\'m aware that this feature exists in Dota 2, unfortunately I don\\'t play enough of it nowadays to comment on its effectiveness or what the low-priority players experience. \\n A final point that I think is very important is correctly aligning player\\'s intentions. I\\'ve talked a lot about this topic here. [This is a comment]( I made that explains what I mean. I think a lot of toxicity can be avoided just by getting like-minded players to play with each other. However, even people on this subreddit seem to not care about the distinction between RANKED and NORMALS. Team builder is actually a great start to this. \\n Finally, within the previous link above is another link in which I breakdown why Korean servers seem to have less trolls. The main point there is that  most Koreans actually PAY to play the game indirectly  as they are paying for time in PC cafes. I\\'m not saying that we should make LoL into a pay-to-play game (although I\\'m sure this would reduce toxicity significantly).

       " Row(content=\"I took a look and you're right however Ashe is still underwhelming.  I like to use Caitlyn as a standard for measuring ADCs \\n Base States \\n \\n Health: Ashe has 5 more Base HP but she scales 1HP / level less compared to Cait. At level 5 they're equal and level 6 Cait has more HP. \\n HP Regen: Cait has more base regen and scales the same as Ashe  \\n Mana: Cait has significantly more mana and equal scaling \\n Mana Regen: Cait has more base regen and better scaling \\n Attack Damage: Cait has slightly more base AD and slightly better scaling \\n Attack Speed: Ashe's base attack speed has a .033 auto attacks more than Cait / second, but equal scaling \\n Armor: Cait has 1.5 more base armor than Ashe and scales the same \\n Range: Cait has 50 more range than Ashe (650- 600) \\n \\n Abilities \\n Focus vs Headshot \\n \\n Focus- stacks 4-8 / second (if out of combat for 3 seconds) until 100 and will then critically damage (100% bonus AD).  \\n Headshot - Gains 1 stack/aa out of brush OR 2 stacks/ aa inside brush. Deals 50% bonus AD at 7/6/5 stacks and can also critically strike. \\n Summary- At level 1 Ashe would have to wait an absolute minimum 25 seconds out of combat before she can use her passive (Regardless of runes and masteries). While Cait's passive encourages auto attacks plus requires an absolute minimum (Assuming no runes and masteries) of 5.26 seconds. From early to late game Caitlyn's passive dominate's Ashe's in terms of usability and damage considering a critical strike with headshot would provide 300% AD and considering how Ashe's passive means less as she builds crit items. \\n \\n Volley vs Peacemaker \\n \\n Mana: Volley- 60 mana. Peacemaker 50-90 (+10/lvl) \\n Cooldown: Volley- 16 s-4 s ( -3 s/lvl). Peacemaker 10-6 ( -1 s/lvl) \\n Damage: Volley-  40-80 damage w/ 1.0 AD ratio. Peacemaker - 20-180 Damage with w/ 1.3 AD ratio.  \\n Range: Volley- 1200. Peacemaker- 1300 \\n Utility: Volley- 57.5^o Cone, applies slows from frost shot, maximum of 7 targets hit (cannot pass through enemies). Peacemaker- straight line, increased range if combo'd with 90 caliber net, no maximum# of units hit, passes through enemies (reduced damage). \\n Summary- Both Skills are very nice to have as volley spread and slows but peacemaker penetrates deeper. However, in terms of damage potential Peacemaker still gives more bang for your buck...er...mana? \\n \\n Frost shot vs 90 Caliber Net \\n \\n Mana: FS - Toggle 8 mana/aa. 90CN- 75 mana \\n Cooldown: FS- toggle cooldown (.2 s?). 90CN- 18 s-10 s (-2 s /lvl) \\n Damage: FS- no damage. 90CN- 80-230 magic damage (+50/lvl) scaling 0.8 AP scaling \\n Range: FS-600 (auto attack). 90CN-1000 \\n Utility: FS- 15%-35% slow (+5%/lvl) for 2 seconds is applied on volley. 90CN- (50% slow) for 1-2s (+0.25s/lvl) AND a 400 unit knockback. Provides more range on peacemaker. \\n Summary: These abilities are not easily comparable due to their uses. The quality of slow at level one on Cait far outweighs Ashe's maxed FS while the duration of slow provided by FS is matched by a maxed 90CN. Situationally 90CN provides better escape and damage while FS provides better Chase, and Kiting.  \\n \\n Hawkshot vs Yordle SnapTrap \\n \\n Mana: HS- no cost.

YST- 80-280 magic damage + 0.6 AP ratio over 1.5 seconds \\n Range: HS- 2500-5500 (+750 / lvl) travel radius and 1000 destination radius. YST- Placement Range is 400 but the traps can be anywhere on the map \\n Utility: HS- passive +3gold/unit destroyed. Provides vision in direction HS travels for 2 seconds and vision of destination for 5 seconds, vision includes brushes. YST- Maximum 3 traps. 1 trap lasts 4 minutes. Addition of a 4th trap will deactivate the 3rd. Placing traps reveals area. 1.5 second snare activates upon contacting within 67 range of trap. Trap gives true sight of champion for 9 seconds.   \\n Summary- Different components to the vision game. Hawkshot does not cost mana and has a huge range that reveals brushes but it does not provide immediate defensive and offensive benefits that YST provides. YST gives CC (snare), damage, and true sight which is amazing in the new vision meta. \\n \\n Enchanted Crystal Arrow vs Ace in the Hole \\n \\n Mana: ECA- 100. AitH- 100. \\n Cooldowns: ECA- 100s-80s (-10s/level). AitH - 90s-60s (-15s/lvl) \\n Damage: ECA- 250/425/600 + 1.0 AP ratio Magic Damage (Splash Damage= 50% of normal damage).

AitH-provides true sight of locked on targets after 1 second channel. Fires a targeted projectile that can be blocked.  \\n Summary- ECA provides great utility for team fights as a strong engage and disengage tool however its AP scaling and magic damage leave it lacking in the late game, also being a skill shot its very easy to miss if used at greater distance.

Despite being strong, she was rarely played after her re-work until Liandry became popular on her. Nerfing Liandry seemed to kill off her popularity, though I continued to play her. \\n Around the same time Nidalee/Kayle both lost their MR per lvl stats, and I think in that same patch the mini-dfg on her Q was also removed.  \\n The cast range on her ult was drastically reduced. \\n \\n Now after all these changes I still thought Kayle was insanely good, but she was never a highly contested pick/ban despite being the best counter to the popular assassin meta at the time. IMO she was THE best pick vs. zed/ahri/lb/syndra etc. and I rarely ever saw it used in SQ or competitive for that matter. \\n \\n Gragas Nerf.

The change to her ult gave Kayle a massive boost in power. She was mainly mana starved (~700 MP at lvl 6, ult cost 100MP) but I haven't had any mana issues on her after this change. I also think adding the AP ratio on the MS of her heal was unnecessary.

He can get a lead quickly using his insanely fast attacks and a hit-and-run playstyle. He can hold the lead by using his multiple evasive maneuvers to avoid getting hit, and he can expand leads very well using very punishing attack strings and low % kills.

       " Row(content='EDIT: Damn, this is long. Perils of typing in a 5-line-high box. Sorry. \\n Thanks for your thorough response. I\\'ve read Harris (and Daniel Wegner\\'s book is decent), and he\\'s a good read.  My problem is twofold: that he doesn\\'t go far enough, and that he goes too far. \\n 1. Not Going Far Enough \\n To quote him: \\n >Harris - \"To talk about determinism is not to argue for fatalism... gives rise to questions \"if everything is determined, why should I do anything? why not sit back?\" To sit back and do nothing is itself a choice, which has consequences...\" \\n But by his own reasoning, this is a choice we cannot make. We cannot choose to give in to fatalism or not - this choice just happens to us. We cannot choose to do nothing, or to do something. So why talk as if it\\'s a possibility? This  does lead  to fatalism. Even if, as a result of hearing his talk, you decide to not \"spend all day in bed from now on\", you didn\\'t really make that choice. \\n >What you think and do effect the future, this is clear, however, you do not chose what you think or do. \\n Then, in effect, it does not affect the future. The future is predetermined. Choices are  part of the unfolding narrative , you might say, but that narrative is pre-fixed. It\\'s going to happen anyway. They \"matter\" only in the sense that they are a fixed cog in the clockwork of time. But since that cog can neither be removed nor changed nor other cogs introduced, they do not \"matter\" in any meaningful sense. \\n >If one had two brains, could one have \\'free will\\' over the other, if one brain had more information about the world than the other?\\n>\"Nope\" \\n The reason for saying that is: We do not create the options that appear to us, however those options result from the information that we have access to at that time. A man who has only vision will have a certain set of options. A man who has vision and hearing would be presented with another, more extensive set. A man who only attends to his thoughts would be presented with options and make his choice logically, based on the \\'coherence\\' of the option. A man who also had access to the rest of his body might also bring into play his \\'gut feeling\\' and global physical sense of a situation. (Our choices are not just thoughts and reasoning, there\\'s feeling too obviously.) \\n The wider the \\'context\\' or extent of awareness, the better and more numerous the options, and the better our choice would be. The maximum \\'free will\\' we could have is if we had access to all the information in the world - i.e. \"God\". The point isn\\'t that we should be able to do  anything , the point is that we should do the  best  thing. \\n The point about two brains: If one brain had full access to all the content of another brain then it\\'s \"will\" would be \"freer\" than that other brain, in the sense of having more access to information, more choices, better choice-making. If we stop thinking of our own brains as \"one thing, that runs us and is us\" and instead take ourselves to be the whole nervous system, we have \"many brains\". \\n So this comes down to the \"me\" that is choosing; where is the perimeter? That is where we affect this. \\n 2. Going Too Far \\n Because my experience is that I don\\'t operate in the way describe. Choice-making is indeed an experience that arises in my awareness, but I am not powerless. Or at least, not the \"I\" that I really am. \"George\", the idea, the collection of thoughts and sequences, has no power. \\n But \"the me who experiences\", I have the ability to include or exclude parts of experience, to recenter my awareness on my thoughts or bodily sensations, to halt any process that starts, or let it through.  This is different from choosing-from-options.  It\\'s actually not even an experience: I cannot say how I do it, it\\'s more of a \"becoming\" or \"shaping of attention\". \\n And this is why Harris gets a bit muddled in his wording. He\\'s talking about \\'perspective 1\\' but  from  \\'perspective 2\\'. Basically, he focuses on content but skips out on consciousness as \\'first cause\\', while depending upon it. \\n We have  a  free will, and it\\'s the ability to shape our distribution of awareness, and to suppress movements that begin in awareness. And that\\'s all we need.  That we don\\'t invent information directly, isn\\'t a problem.  We just want maximum, unconstrained choice, corresponding to the maximum information; we want to become as close to \"God\" as possible.  Meta-choosing? \\n Meanwhile, Harris - It\\'s been interesting to watch his  shifting views  I jest, but he\\'s shifting somewhere. Wegner almost gets to a more interesting, expansive view in his book, then draws back in the last chapter, disappointingly.', summary='We might not have freedom to create information, that is to create options, but surely nobody views \\'free will\\' that way anyway.

While the amount of time people will spend playing Rebirth is still unknown, it can be reasonably assumed that it will be even greater than the original because of the various improvements to the game which I will describe in more detail down below. \\n One of the more disappointing aspects of the first game was items synergies, or in other words the combing of two or more items to make cool interactions. They were disappointing mostly because a lot of item synergies that you thought would work didn’t and tear effects/interactions were rather basic and paled in compassion to the effectiveness of other damage dealing methods. \\n Thankfully, this is a problem that the creator was conscious of and made a point to fix in rebirth, and from what I've seen he has done a great job. Combine the better functionality of item synergies with an expanded item pool and it opens up the possibilities for a lot great combinations. Additionally a lot of the shitter items from the original that are in the new version have gotten buffed to make them more viable. \\n The character selection is also greatly improved with the addition of 3 new characters, as well as changes to older ones to make them better. One character in particular seems to be stronger than most and appears to be a pseudo easy for people who are struggling. As someone who is just getting to Isaac this may be of interest to you, because despite what people may say Isaac is as hard as fuck. Especially to a brand new player. Granted you do have to unlock him first a reasonable effort before you can turn on easy mode. I even use this character sometimes when I get frustrated at the game and I want to become a damage dealing power house. \\n The Isaac’s PC community also plays a large role in making Isaac the phenomenon that it is. You can always find plenty of streamers and Youtubers playing the game at all times so you can get your Isaac fix even when you’re not playing. I would recommend Coblatstreak as an Isaac streamer and Northenlion as an Isaac YouTube largely because they are the most popular and they serve as a nice/accessible way to view Isaac content. \\n Speaking of the community, the Meta game of rebirth is still in its infancy so you can get on the ground floor of people who are better at the game than most discovering cool combinations and sharing them with the community. And who knows maybe you will discover a synergy yourself that I kind of doubt it but anything is possible and I would love to be proven wrong. Compare that to old Isaac were deals with the devil became recognized as the best way to win and resulted in a rather stagnant meta game. \\n Also, the older Isaac had some performance issues mostly running at 30fps and frequently dipping below that in rooms with a lot of shit (sometimes literally) on screen. Compare this to rebirth which runs at a smooth 60fps 99% of the time, even on my relatively old laptop. So even if your computer isn't that great rebirth should still run better than vanilla Isaac. This increase in frame rate objectively makes better because it makes dodging much more responsive. On the other hand this doubling of the frame rate makes the game run at double speed making accurate/smart dogging. For newer players this may be relevant because becoming better dogging is one of the first steps to becoming good at Isaac. After all, health in this game is a precious resource that needs to be protected so you can have enough of it to trade away. \\n I personally prefer the older Isaacs art style because it looked much cleaner to me and I like games that have a simple but clean aesthetic to them. (The UI in Destiny is a great example of a style that I adore.)The original art style felt more unique to me where as this pixel art style, while nice, is a style that I fell has been overdone to the point of exhaustion. Preferences aside, the new art style is far more detailed and the lighting effects and subtle particle effects add nice little touches to the game. If art style is something that matters to you then that's worth considering.\", summary='Rebirth all the way. \\n P.S I could give you more detail, and I will if you want it, but now that I look at this wall of text that I’ve created I’m going to stop myself. \\nP.S.S Feel free to ask me any other questions that you may have because this is a lot here to ask questions about.

       " Row(content=\"Because everyone is saying IBM as the OS dev, I want to post the correct answer which is: The hardware manufacturer (or possibly the university you were at, were that the case). \\n Windows (and, rolling alllll the way back to its origins, CP/M) and linux are complete weird outliers in the history of operating systems as, prior to their advent, there was really no such thing as a commodity operating system. Historically, it worked like this: \\n \\n 1950s : There is no operating system. Your company writes the software to do the calculations on the bare metal or, as the industry formed, have another firm write it for you \\n \\n 1960s : In the commercial world, batch control systems start appearing. Not like a modern operating system almost at all, was simply a program that would read another program from your punch card deck or what have you and run it, doing that same cycle alll day to process all the jobs that needed doing. With computers getting more popular for business use, the manufacturers made them more appealing by providing the machines with some of this systems software so as to lower the barrier to entry. At the same time, computer research is starting to get hot and heavy at educational institutions like MIT and Stanford as well as research firms such as the infamous Bell Labs and, among other things, they start research projects playing with the ideas we more formally consider operating systems in a modern sense and these systems are shared among universities and used by students. By the end of the sixties, multitasking(they called it timesharing back then) had been invented by the research institutions and companies like IBM (but note that there were MANY others including GE, Honeywell, Burroughs &c.) were packaging their mainframes with fairly advanced suites of their own software tailor-made for the hardware including control systems (what we'd now consider rudimentary operating systems), development software like FORTRAN, COBOL and RPG, and debugging systems to get the buyer up and running right away. \\n \\n 1970s : Computers are now becoming a critical business asset and all of the major manufacturers sell their systems with bundles of custom software, including, in many cases, multiple selections of tailor-made OS with each option serving a slightly different use case. On the research side, Ken and Dennis over at Bell Labs write UNIX which blows up internally and they start licensing to other institutions, including schools like Berkeley who modified and repackaged it into the still very popular Berkeley Software Distribution, or BSD, which is still active and in widespread use today (a large chunk of OSX is from BSD) and is one of the first cases of an OS written not by a hardware manufacturer crossing the boundary from the research world into the commercial with success. In the mid 70s, as chip fabrication gets better and better, the personal computer revolution begins. With very modest resources (one could most certainly not run Bell UNIX or BSD on an Apple II) the hardware manufacturers had to write their own simple monitor software, usually a BASIC interpreter, to be written to a ROM chip inside the machine so that it actually did something useful when turned on. As the manufacturers rolled out floppy drive addons they generally wrote and distributed their own Disk Operating Systems (generally just an extension to the existing monitor or BASIC interpreter) so users could read and write the files on them. As the 70s come to a close, almost every computer, except for those belonging to groups that had been so bold as to license a UNIX or BSD, is running an OS written by the hardware manufacturer as part of a cohesive system. A small company called Microsoft gets into the software game by writing BASIC monitor software on contract for some of those companies making early consumer computers. At the very end, as the price of the parts made to build consumer computers drops and the parts become easier to acquire, hobbyists begin building their own computers and tend to build them somewhat similarly so that they can share programs they've written with each other. \\n \\n 1980s : Up to the tail end of the 70s the biggest reason that there's no commodity operating system is that there's no standardization in the hardware. The company has to make the OS because no one else's software can run on their platform. The big guys like this, because it means vendor lock-in. But the home computer hobbyists and the cottage industries that support them don't have those kinds of resources, so they have to standardize so they can pool their resources. At the open of the 80s, a thriving community of users of what are called 'CP/M machines' or 'S-100' machines are born. Most of these systems are built from a kit and use the cheap and common Z80 processor and a defacto-standardized bus called the S-100 bus that allows people to share peripheral designs with each other and small manufacturers to make cards that would work in most of these people's machines. A Disk Operating System called CP/M was developed to run on these machines -- one of the first times that an OS was sold that was targeted at a community specified platform rather than being bundled with the hardware it was written for. IBM, seeing that this market is exploding, thanks to the standard offering so much community support that the barrier to consumer entry is almost nonexistant, decides they want a piece of the pie and design the IBM PC based on simple, off the shelf components to appeal to the new market. They ask Microsoft, now well known for its BASIC rom software, to write the BASIC that will come installed on the machine. IBM decides in the process that they're going to need a Disk Operating System as the computer will have a built-in floppy drive and Microsoft convinces them that they've got something in the works that they can sell them. Microsoft is bluffing, but ends up pulling a deal out of their ass by buying a variant of CP/M that a small-time one-man software developer had written for a few tens of thousands of dollars. This software becomes Microsoft's MS-DOS -- originally an in-house piece of software meant for and bundled by IBM with the PC. But Microsoft, like any hungry young company that just pulled off a deal this ridiculous, gets greedy as hell and makes sure that their agreement is not to develop the software  for  IBM but to rather license it to them. This proves a brilliant move when third parties, such as the newly spawned Compaq, start copying the easy to reverse engineer PC hardware and begin selling clone hardware. Needing an operating system, they also license it from Microsoft and a new community standard is born. At this point, Microsoft is the only software-only company selling operating system software on a commercial basis. UNIX, still owned by Bell Labs, is widespread but in a much different way; Most enterprise hardware manufacturers license the UNIX source from Bell and modify it into a system specific to their hardware which is then bundled with it. \\n \\n 1990s : This is the last chapter before the modern world. A cheeky kid at the University of Helsinki named Linus Torvalds decides to write a system functionally equivalent to the UNIX he uses on the school systems for his newly bought intel-386 based PC clone desktop for fun because he likes using UNIX and is just that nerdy. He shows it to his friends online and it rapidly becomes a fully functional operating system core thanks to the many hands of interested hobbyists. This core gets married to the programs from a much older project called GNU which had been started in the 80s by a student at MIT named Richard Stallman with the goal of cloning UNIX so that the whole world could freely use, share and modify license-free software just as the researchers at universities had been doing since the 60s, and suddenly there was a brand new operating system for the IBM-clone standard that could run the same kind of software which had been written by the big boys for their very proprietary enterprise hardware. A new era has begun of people writing operating systems to work with a hardware standard instead of for a specific piece of hardware, and this is where we still are today -- linux and windows (also BSD as Berkeley realized in the 80s that very little of the system that they had been hacking together for years was actually proprietary Bell Labs UNIX code anymore so they removed those bits and released the whole thing for free) are, for most intents and purposes, the  only  operating systems in wide use that are not written by the hardware manufacturer. Big iron guys like Oracle, Fujitsu, SGI and others still, to this day, write generally UNIX-based operating system packages which are bundled with their systems. \\n \\n \\n Wayyy\", summary=\"The OS used to be, and for the most part in enterprise systems still is, written by the hardware manufacturer.

       " Row(content=\"A collection of thoughts and advice from a lover and veteran of Singed: \\n Nearly every champion in the game counters Singed; his laning phase is miserably weak early game. \\n I used to spam Singed, even first picking him in ranked, until I just got completely exhausted from fighting manaless champions with sustain over and over again. You have to recall 5 times for every time they do and eventually you'll naturally fall behind. \\n With Singed though, the laning phase shouldn't be regarded as too important. Singed is a fairly awful laner and when playing him you need to think ahead, draw aggro from their whole team and never be afraid to pop R + Ghost and go balls deep. Singed can only be considered strong in lane when his Insanity Potion is running; when it's on cooldown it's advisable to back off of your opponent unless ahead. Singed is at his very strongest in lane when you're shoving the creeps into the enemy tower, warded up, and repeatedly diving and flinging the enemy laner out of the tower. Use common sense when doing this, as certain champs will simply annihilate you under their tower (Darius, Kennen). InvertedComposer states that Singed's strongest level is level 2 - this is only true is your opponent is level 1, but I am inclined to disagree. I find that he is at his strongest whenever he his kiting the enemy team. Many players state that Singed's late game is 'OP'. This is simply not true; ultra late game Singed just isn't tanky enough when compared to dedicated tank champions - the need to build items like Liandri's and Serath's Embrace sacrifices too many slots on squishy mage items to tank a 6 item AP/AD carry's damage. You will have difficulty in charging down the enemy carries in teamfight's late game for this reason; it's advisable that you run around the middle of the teamfight poisoning as many targets as possible. \\n However, one thing I enjoy the most about Singed is the fact that the champ himself comes covered with an insurance policy. Fed lane opponent? No problem; pop ult, charge and fling them, poison minions and run through their towers to proxy farm. Die or recall, buy homeguard, repeat. The sheer amount of games I've won after losing my lane and doing this is astonishing, a true lose lane/win game champion. \\n The other aspect that I enjoy with playing Singed is the fact that I  want  to be camped as hard as possible by the enemy jungler. In fact, I make it a major objective to waste as much of the enemy jungler's time as possible. Don't cry about being camped when playing Singed; make it a goal - seek it, relish it, enjoy it. Singed is the best attention whore in the game. If at any point in the game no one is giving you any attention, run into the enemy nexus, pop ult and farm two lanes at once. Force their attention on you at all times. \\n Out of all the playstyles available for Singed, the one I've had by far the most success with is Druiddroid's proxy Singed, and this was after the death streak nerf. If you don't know the playstyle, search 'Druiddroid' on Youtube and go from there. I did this a lot in ranked and it skyrocketed me up from Plat 5 to Plat 1 - and I repeat, this was  after  the death streak nerf, so don't call me a noob for exploiting a well-known loophole in the game's mechanics. \\n There are some champions, however, that are at the very best of times an absolute ballache for Singed to lane against. Kennen, Karma, Ryze, Kayle, Vladimir, Jayce and, of course, Teemo can all be beaten with well-calculated plays, but can beat you easily without any clever tricks themselves. For those champions, beating Singed is like breathing for them; a natural, sub-conscious process that doesn't demand anything out of the ordinary. To outplay them as Singed, you will have to either a) hide in brush and pop out to last hit. b) push to level 2, pop ghost, fling and sky auto them into your creeps with poison and ignite (extremely risky move that can fail easily) c) proxy them at lvl 1 and write the whole lane off (even riskier). I'm done with those matchups and I've put Singed to rest and taken up jungling now. I'm hoping for jungle Singed to become competitive in S4 then I can play my favourite champion without my balls aching from the huge menu of available counterpicks. What's that . . . they picked a Garen against you? Cool, but they have a Janna support who is going to make your game incredibly hard for you. Singed can just as easily be counterpicked across lanes as he can be in lane. Every champion counters Singed. \\n And, slightly off-top, why the fuck is Singed one of the top counterpicks to Nasus on championselect.net? Holy shitballs, that couldn't be more wrong. Nasus laughs in the face of Singed's attempts to harass him in laning phase. EDIT: nevermind, someone changed it now, but I swear it was like that for a couple of years. \\n What champions should Singed always win laning phase against? None. Every champion in the game can be played as a counter if played correctly. Singed has some glaring weaknesses that are incredible easy to exploit in laning phase, which is why I'm hoping to take him into the new jungle. An often overlooked stat on tank champions is base scaling magic resist, which some champions get for free and others do not. Singed does not get any free MR per level, and will have around 30 MR at lvl 18 with no bonuses. This makes him exceptionally weak to magic damage and places a lot of stress upon MR itemisation. The worst situation you can have is when you're playing versus a tough AD top laner, demanding a build for armour, as well as a fed AP mid, which you simply can never have enough gold to cover sufficient armour and MR for. If you want to counter Singed, AP champs will make him work much harder to cover the costs of the MR that other champs like Nasus get for free in generous amounts. \\n Contrary to popular belief, Singed is not an easy champion to play with at all. It always makes me smile when I see the enemy Lee Sin write in all chat 'ROFL noob pick Singed skillless champ GG'. Singed is not an obviously skill-based champ like Lee Sin, but actually requires a wealth of game knowledge and some esoteric keyboard mechanics to completely master effectively. InvertedComposer's famous guide explains these keyboard mechanics in great detail, the Sky Auto Attack being the most essential of them. Note that you can no longer produce invisible poison with the new keybind interface changes. \\n For resources, search for guides/streams/videos from the three Grandmaster Singed players: InvertedComposer, Sirhcez and DruidDroid. The three of them cover every playstyle, build and aspect of the champion that there is. As much as I respect InvertedComposer, I find his guide to be somewhat damning of certain items that I have had great success with, Twin Shadows being one that comes to mind. It's an amazing guide, the best game guide ever written in fact, but be aware that he likes to stick rigidly to his math. His champion matchup summaries are useful but assume far too much skill of the reader, making them less useful for beginners. His guide is definitely written with the advanced player in mind. A special mention also goes out to Ranka Lee, another exceptionally talented Singed player who has also written an incredible guide. The Korean player Shy's Singed gained a lot of attention last year, but I feel that this was simply because Singed stood out as a pick in that year's tournament meta; Shy is not a fantastic Singed player and his builds are questionable. Shy stands out for building spellvamp, which I feel is a waste of gold, although Sirhcez has done this with notable success (more likely due to his mechanical excellence giving him the slack to build inefficient items). And, of course, let's not forget Dyrus's don't-give-a-fuck-style Singed. \\n If Riot nerfs and stops making resourceless top lane champs then I might consider returning to playing Singed again, but due to the popularity of these champions I doubt that this will happen. Mobility Creep (steady increase of mobile champs and items like BotRK, which is the kryptonite of Singed) has also a part to play in slowly killing off my favourite champ - very frequently do I find games where I can't seem to get a single fling off these days. Also, Teemo is getting indirectly buffed with the new masteries in Season 4, as well as a further penalty on deathstreaks, I feel Singed will become a very mediocre top lane pick in the new season.\", summary=\"Everything counters Singed.

       " Row(content=\"In all seriousness, once an ordinary person is given dominion over others, either real or imagined, and reason to believe they're in the right, regardless what the law says, abuse is a short walk from responsible law enforcement.  In a nut shell, some people can handle the burden of power while others view power as privilege.  We won't have any level of safety, either from criminals or law enforcement until a system can be developed that balances power with accountability. \\n But who is the judge of the judges of the judges, who watches the watchmen? \\n Allow me to give some context. \\n The popular viewpoint at the outset of WWI was that the war itself would burn out in no time.  The ferocity and sheer scale were seen as unsustainable.  This, not only turned out to be wrong, but a gross miscalculation.  When judging humanities capacity for cruelty, mindlessness and aggression, one almost always comes up short.  So, when a system of governance is created, with the goal of extenuating humanities ideals and mitigating its faults, focus on the good often leaves too much room for the bad. \\n the founding fathers, while truly visionary, couldn't have foreseen the result of their grand vision.  Anymore than we can.  Thus, trying to write laws and regulations to reign in the force the masses bring to bare everyday, is virtually impossible.  So, were caught in a trap of idealism, cruelty, and humbris.  Seeing humanity as better than they are, weaker than they will be and capable of rational action is only as effective as those forces will allow. \\n One cannot see the universe from outside, nor can we really judge our worthiness from within.  A corrupt politician will try to make corrupt laws, a responsible law enforcement officer will enforce that law.  Likewise a trustworthy politician will make good laws, and an irresponsible law enforcement officers will subvert those laws.  Expecting, or assuming, that all laws will be or are good and all law enforcement will be or are responsible is foolish, as is the converse. \\n We're really at a point in history where we'll either begin the process of balancing personal with security or one will win out over the other. \\n Imagine for a moment, a world with total personal freedom .  No higher responsible party or body to exact control over the population to ensure safety amd security.  In essence a return to a more natural, animalistic state.  Murder or theft or rape would go unpunished.  Goodness and charity ignored.  In a world with total security and no personal freedom, the exact same conclusion appears.  Though through wildly different means and contexts. \\n Humanities ideal is a place between the two where we can feel safe, and free.  Finding that balance in most cases necessitates sacrifice on one side or the other.  Do we want drug smugglers to be allowed to operate freely?  Well,  the problem is drug smugglers aren't stupid.  The best way to remain hidden, in an open society, is to appear open.  So, to stop that, you have to attack openness.  That leads to isolation, xenophobia and ultimately corruption. \\n So, what to do?  Until the day we finally listen to the part of each and everyone of us that says that we're frightened of our own mortality, that all we know for sure is we're alive and that life, in all its form and complexity, is still discovering itself, we'll never find the context for a truly free, open, safe, and fair society.  Until then, we'll continue to fight, live in fear and isolation and toil away in obscure pointlessness. \\n We're trapped here.  On an island.  There aren't any advanced civilizations that will come save us.  Physics seems fairly settled on that, unfortunately.  So, if we want the future to resemble, in any way, our highest ideals, the burden is at our feet.  The answer to world peace is concensus, complete agreement on what that means and entails.  The cessation of hostilities. \\n But, we often don't see mucb further than our own noses.  Once the seed of hate is sown, it grows.  It's a virulent creature.  Will we choose peace or destruction?  Because, unlike WWI, where no one really knew what humanity was capable of yet, we're reminded everyday of our own machinations.  We're all too aware of how close we are to the brink.  WWIII, which may already be in full swing, will be the proving ground for either love or hate.  And if there are historians left after the dust settles, how will they look upon our choices?  Will they chronicle our demise or our triumph?  The choice is ours. \\n It may not seem like my perspective belongs here, how can the fate of the world have anything to do with some backwards law or bad ruling?  But if you consider the US to be prototype for a better world, then our mistakes may decide the future of humanity. \\n Empathy, is so easily dismissed when hate and paranoia are present in even the smallest doses.

The major thing is that GW2 doesn't really cater to a big build archive like GW1 did because of builds being more of guidelines for play styles versus set in stone builds and on top of that team comps are so flexible that there is no real meta team comps or specific content driven team comps that were good to have available to be seen on a website. One could argue that in PvP this is less true for the specific personal builds and I can agree with that but I had a simple suggestion for you which fits in with that idea. \\n For GW2 something I would really love is a website like icy veins for WoW. Now I hope WoW doesn't spark any thoughts of taboo or something because I feel people who appreciated websites like that would certainly appreciate a similar website for GW2. \\n My reasoning for the suggestion is simple. Specific builds and team comps are unimportant for GW2 because of the predetermined skills on weapons, healing skill slot, utility skill slots and elite skill slot. What would be great is a really robust guide for specific classes and their different play styles similar to how icy veins does their guides for each classes spec on their website. Things can obviously be discussed like the different utilities what goes good together etc but the idea of having the general setup, the gear, the skills, the tricks and tips altogether instead of collecting a large number of builds that don't necessarily rate well up against each other would be a very attractive future for a website like yours. \\n This type of a website also is great for a smaller community of editors and contributors because you can go to PvE players in the community and ask for their help creating the build versus hoping someone in the community will actually come and make their build and post a bunch of good info to go along with the build. \\n All in all as a\", summary=\"I think your website is good for what it does but I believe you might wanna take a turn from trying to recreate PvXwiki for GW2 and instead create something more like icy veins for GW2.

It is a card not as stable as other competing the five slot such as beltcher and loatheb. \\n The card itself is torn in between two archetype of paladin deck. For a midrange deck, you want to play on curve and avoid playing combo card. You want cards that can consistently get value as you run light in card draw. On the other hand, control paladin aims at dropping big dude and controlling the board which should theoretically be great for bolvar. However as control paladin care less about tempo and less likely to grow bolvar fast enough, they will simply opt for big threat that has powerful effect like Rag and Boom instead of pure stat.

You are able to wait for perfect moment to drop Bolvar either to bait out removal, or when your other threat has absorbed enough removal. You can also create swing potential by following it after a wild pyro combo. It is rare to be able to drop a big threat after a board clear scenario, which Bolvar is one of the cards able to do that. \\n I agree that Bolvar is not great in current meta or existing archetype, but it is far more playable than druid of the fang for several reasons: Druid deck does not have room to run any beast outside of druid of the claw, which is a T10 combo that basically does nothing for the win condition. Druid deck also wants sticky minion and a relatively fast gameplan so a 5 mana 7/7 (or a 8/8 like Fel Reaver) does not help with that.

       " Row(content='Alright, people who voice their opinions in these threads tend to be those who have spent a fortune on cards and don\\'t like others to play with proxies so I may as well take up the opposite side. \\n There is nothing wrong with proxies. Absolutely nothing. \\n First of all, what you\\'re copying is the data for a game, which Wizards doesn\\'t own. Even out intellectual-property-is-sacrosanct legal system recognizes this: you can\\'t patent or copyright the rules and mechanics of a game, which includes the information of any given card. The format in which it\\'s presented, e.g. the art, the specific text format, the logos and names, are all copyrighted, but the information itself is not. \\n That said, being legal isn\\'t a moral justification. There are roughly two parties that are injured in some way, unjustly or not, by proxying: those who don\\'t play with proxies and have spent money on cards and the people who have developed the cards themselves (Wizards/Hasbro). I\\'m going to address the latter first. \\n The issue of  whether you can \"own\" (have some justified form of monopoly on use) information is contentious one, both philosophically and practically. So, rather than make the issue immensely complex by delving into the logical basis for property ownership I\\'m going to address a more practical position. Specifically, I\\'m going to present the extension of your position, that proxies are wrong, and see if you agree with what that entails. If you are acting in accordance with the following points, then you are free of ethical contradictions with your beliefs as to whether a company can own information, if not, well you should probably revise your position. \\n \\n You can\\'t pirate music, movies or television. This goes without saying. If you think a company can own information then taking information that they produce without their consent is by definition stealing. The fact that the products are different is irrelevant, Hasbro is a company just like EMI, Sony, Disney, &c., stealing from one is no different from stealing from another (though the magnitude of \"wrongness\" may be different, it will never be right). \\n \\n You can\\'t use non-sanction booster simulators. Using these is taking information that Wizards produced and using it without their consent. The purpose for which you are using it is slightly different, but only marginally. In both cases, proxying and simulating, you are usually practicing without having to actually spend money. The fact that you may spend money later on the product is irrelevant: stealing isn\\'t justified by patronizing the company later and proxy-ers usually buy cards from Wizards too, and you don\\'t seem to think that is a defense. The root of the issue is that you are using their information, without their permission, in order to not spend your money. If you agree with the premise that they own that information, you\\'re acting unethically. \\n \\n You can\\'t proxy to playtest. Same reasoning as above. The fact that you\\'ll probably eventually go out and buy some of the cards that you\\'ve \"stolen\" doesn\\'t justify the theft of the information in the first place. What\\'s more, since people who proxy to playtest do so in order to avoid buying all the cards that they\\'re considering buying, it is almost always the case that when you playtest with proxies you\\'re using at least a few proxies which you\\'ll never buy the cards for, which is an even less defensible form of theft than if you go and buy the cards later. \\n \\n You can\\'t use cockatrice. This almost goes without saying as well. There is absolutely no substantial difference between playing online with virtual proxies and playing in person with physical proxies. You could make the argument that you can play cockatrice if you only play with decks which you own the physical equivalence of. I don\\'t think this is true (you buy a specific representation of the information along with the rights to use it, not the information in all forms. For comparison, if I buy a game on XBox I\\'m not justified in pirating the ported PC version), but even if it is, very few people play on cockatrice with only their cards. And, even if you are one of those people, you\\'re in an ethically grey area by knowingly allowing, essentially, thieves to steal: by playing with people who are virtually proxying you are an accomplice in their theft, without people to play with, such as you, they wouldn\\'t be able to steal (or at least wouldn\\'t want to). \\n \\n \\n There are more extensions but I think I\\'ve gotten my point across. If believe proxying is wrong because Wizards is unjustly harmed, then you need to refrain from a whole bunch of other activities or you\\'re a hypocrite. \\n That said, there is still the second point: proxying is wrong because you are injuring people who don\\'t proxy. This is a much weaker position, and so I will defend it directly. \\n The fact that you\\'ve invested resources in something doesn\\'t mean that people who manage to obtain the same result with less resources would be unjustly harming you. This is basically the crux of the \"proxy-ers hurt those who have legitimately obtained cards\" argument, and it is pretty absurd. \\n \\n Standards for what constitute \"legitimately obtained\" are completely arbitrary. If I acquire all my cards by opening booster packs, then people who buy singles or trade for theirs are reducing the feeling of accomplishment I\\'ve had in assembling my collection. If I acquire all my cards by winning them, having invested only a small sum, people who buy any cards are trivializing my accomplishments in assembling my collection. If I only spend money I\\'ve earned at a minimum wage job, people who spend money they\\'ve inherited or haven\\'t worked as hard for are reducing my feeling of accomplishment. And so on and so forth. Saying \"people who proxy are reducing my accomplishment\" is simply setting an arbitrary bar that people have to meet (buy the cards in an acceptable manner) to be deemed worthy of playing with them. \\n \\n Hypothetically, if you played with Bill Gates, he could easily afford a playset of every card ever printed. If he did that in your playgroup, I guarantee that you would feel like he was cheapening the feeling of worth you\\'ve gathered in buying your cards. But that doesn\\'t mean that he would be entirely legitimate in doing so. One of the major factors in Magic is wealth: a competitive standard deck can cost over $600, modern frequently goes above $1000 and legacy and vintage both cost more than I really want to think about. Excluding someone from playing with you based upon wealth or the amount the they are willing to spend is therefore absurd: it\\'s making an arbitrary barrier to play based upon a factor that shouldn\\'t be related to gameplay itself (net worth). No one likes thinking that people have to pay huge amounts to win or even play Magic, but by opposing proxies that\\'s a logical stance you\\'re effectively siding with. \\n \\n By standing against proxying you\\'re basically saying that external factors, such as enjoyment of physical cards rather than proxies, should have some impact on the game. And that simply isn\\'t the case. Personally, I like owning cards. I like the art, I like the flavor text, I like organizing them, I like the feeling of gathering a collection. But not everyone feels the same way. If someone doesn\\'t care in the slightest about the art or the flavor text, forcing them to buy cards to play serves no purpose. If everyone in my group loved foils and refused to play without them, we would be wrong to frown on anyone who wanted to play with us who didn\\'t conform to our idiosyncratic standard. Forcing everyone to buy cards is akin to that: requiring physical ownership is a more common standard, but it is no less arbitrary. \\n \\n Most importantly, why should the cards someone else plays with matter at all to you? If you get joy from building a collection, great, go have fun. But not everyone enjoys that. People enjoy different aspects of Magic, and collecting isn\\'t always one of them. There is no reason that you should let their actions upset you, so why not do the moral thing and encourage them to be happy? Forcing someone to enjoy the same aspects of magic as you do is like forcing Johnnies to become Spikes: there is a lot to love about Magic which is why it is so sad when people are prevented from focusing on what they love best, be it collecting or creating awesome combos, or whatever. There are advantages to physical cards that proxiers will never have: the feeling of investment, the art, the knowledge that you\\'re supporting the game, the ability to use them to enter tournaments, &c. But if those things don\\'t matter to someone, why should they be forced to care about them? \\n \\n \\n I think I\\'ve more than made my point by now. There is nothing wrong with proxying. This is a contentious position in this subreddit and I will be happy to debate someone further, but I think that it should be clear by this point that there is very little moral justification for being against proxying. \\n NB : That isn\\'t to say that there shouldn\\'t be standards about what proxies can be used. There should, just as there should be standards for what cards can be used in a play group. Saying that proxies should be allowed is not the same as saying that everyone should be able to pack their decks with moxen and loti: that would ruin the meta-game, and ultimately, the group\\'s fun just as surely as if someone had bought them.', summary='I don\\'t blame you; holy god, wall of text. If you are against proxying you should also be against piracy and cockatrice.

The rest of the field is playing a mix of Countertop, Landstill (wow memories), Goblins, Merfolk with some Death & Taxes, Junk/Rock, Elves, Burn, Dredge and Belcher mixed in. Like I said, decently competetive tier decks with mostly solid players. This tournament had the addition of two newer players - they seemed to be close friends - we\\'ll call them Pierre and Maurice. This is good. They seemed like okay dudes and new players is always a good thing, right?? \\n I was having a fairly good run that night. First round I got paired up against Burn, which worked well in my favour. The match ended quickly (turn 1 kill, turn 2 kill for me) and I had some time to hang out and wonder around what was usually a fairly chill atmosphere. I suddenly hear yelling errupting from Maurice\\'s table. He\\'s playing against Landstill... He\\'s playing his deck full of artifacts and weird cards against Landstill. And he\\'s not happy that Force of Will, Spell Pierce and Standstill are cards. Maurice\\'s graveyard consists of odds and ends including a mana myr, an Azorious Signet and some other random cards. Oh, and artifact lands - lots of those because he was also being Crucible-Wasteland locked.

I COULDN\\'T PLAY A FUCKING CARD! WHAT THE FUCK? YOUR DECK IS FUCKING GAYASS SHIT!

I mean, this guy went from a 2 to 10 in under a second. The LGS owner - the coolest guy ever, btw, guy has a motherfucking EYE-PATCH - he\\'s standing there trying not to laugh. \\n So Maurice calms down eventually but you can tell this guy is fucking agitated now. We all play a few more rounds, Maurice is quiet for the most part. I ended up doing well, losing to Dredge because of a silly play mistake. If I had to guess by the level of noise, Maurice probably got paired with Rock/Junk, Goblins or other similar \"fair\" decks. By some stroke of chance, I got paired with him for the next round. \\n I sit across from him and shuffle up. I draw my 7. I made 16 Goblins or something silly on my first turn. He scoops (surprisingly quiet about it). Second game I turn 3 Grapeshotted him for 21 (okay, a little bit of showboating here). \\n \"Motherfucking goblin fucking auto-win decks.

The best part is that he goes up to the LGS owner AND STARTS BUYING SINGLES FOR HIS DECK! \\n So the usuals in the store are just kind of laughing at this point - all buisness for the LGS is good buisness, and the fact that Maurice clearly has no idea what the hell Legacy metagaming is means that no one really cared (he had gone 0-0-X anyways). \\n The round finishes (almost went to time, stupid Landstill) and Maurice is fuming at a table sleeving about 10-15 cards. I had the luck of sitting down next to Maurice while he got paired up with Merfolk. Between my playing (was playing against Junk/Rock) I hear the Merfolk player go, \"Uhh, isn\\'t that banned in Legacy...?\" I look over, and Maurice has a motherfucking TOLARIAN ACADEMY sitting on his board. Everyone paying attention goes, \"Yeah, that\\'s never going to be unbanned.\" \\n Maurice turns to the LGS owner and goes silent. \\n \"Why didn\\'t you tell me this was banned? I demand a refund.

       " Row(content='I was looking for a good opportunity for a first post. The subject of human and animal minds has been my main field of research for the past 8 years, so I\\'m quite happy to have found something where I might be able to contribute a little. \\n Judging from the source, the study looks certainly interesting and a valid enterprise, but I don\\'t think it supports the conclusion drawn about metacognitive abilities. Here\\'s why: \\n \\n Even if the results were sufficient evidence for the judgment that the studied chimps exhibited actual meta-cognition, no generalization is possible. We are effectively extending the chimps\\' own representational (including self-representational) faculties by teaching them to use a lexigram-based language with syntax and a grammar that (theoretically) allows for indefinite extension (through chaining, but this aspect isn\\'t necessary for what\\'s discussed in the study, only compositionality is). \\nBy learning the language, a chimp learns ways of constructing and compositioning representations it wouldn\\'t have available without being taught. So even if the study establishes meta-cognition in the subjects, there is sufficient reason to very highly suspicious of generalizations á la \"Chimps have meta-cognition\". The cognitive-plasticity afforded by the chimp nervous-systems enables it to learn how to use a language - and this in turn may provide the basis for meta-representational and potentially meta-cognitive abilities. - To be fair, the quote from the team that did the study is at least a bit cautious when it comes to such generalizations by using modifiers like \"strongly suggests\" and \"closely related\". \\n \\n As a comment by \"gwrede\" on the source-site already says - \"meta-cognition\" is quite a fancy word for only going to look at something when you don\\'t know it already. In the study, it was the chimp\\'s job to tell what\\'s hidden. The most complex thing the chimp has to be able to do is learn that its jobs is to push the button that represents what is hidden in a certain location. From there on, all that is needed is that the chimp knows (not necessarily explicitly) that it has the ability to go places and look at things, that what it needs to look at is at a certain location, and the faculty to not have to go and look if it already has a representation of the target. The motor-program for going to look is selected and initiated when there  no representation of the target when one is needed, and is not initiated otherwise. This requires neither meta-representation nor meta-cognition, only the capacity to direct ones actions on the basis of one\\'s representation of a certain target (whatever is hidden at the given location) - i.e. pressing the right button or selecting a motor-program to attain the needed representation before being able to do so.

       " Row(content='I have seen him in LCS... \\n Actually, he\\'s common in solo queue. In fact, a couple of days ago, there was this huge binge on Tryndamere players. There was one in almost every game that a pro player was streaming. Even below Diamond, though, Platinum has seen an increase in Tryndamere play. Also split pushing has never, and will never, be considered an \"unconventional tactic\". It\\'s very common. \\n You must not understand neither how split pushing works nor how Tryndamere works. I\\'ll break down split pushing, then go back to why Tryndamere is extremely strong in the role and \"meta\". \\n Split pushing is a strategy that revolves around constantly applying pressure to a different side of the map where action is usually happening. This forces the enemy to consider either going to stop the split pusher or force an objective or teamfight. \\n>If you just stay in your lane and counterpush, the lane will be either frozen or pushed back. \\n If you send one person to go stop a split pusher, that split pusher is still being effective. Why because strong split pushers have certain qualities. Let\\'s break a few of those down: \\n \\n Strong 1v1 capabilities   \\n Fast wave clear   \\n High Escape Potential   \\n Vision granting abilities \\n Cross-Map Presence \\n \\n Granted, not every split pusher has every single one of these. The stronger ones, however, usually have more than one. If they don\\'t, they compensate with wards or summoner spells. Regardless, if the split pusher lacks that last trait, Cross-Map Presence (think Shen, TF, Noct, Teleport, GP Ult) then they are generally poor in teamfights. Until he\\'s farmed and can 2 shot the carry while still Exhausted/Blinded/Feared/Slowed/Stunned, Tryndamere is almost irrelevant in fights. Annoying, yes, but only for around 5 seconds. And he\\'s kiteable, even with his E. Shaco can\\'t do much, Nidalee\\'s actual teamfight is terrible (she excels at poking and can do more work when they\\'re low, but besides that..). Teemo can act as a Ranged DPS source, but he won\\'t be as relevant as an ADC and would be more effective blinding the enemy ADC, but he can\\'t walk through the entire team to do that. This lack of teamfight presence means that they can not be in a fight and still not be missed all that much. Since they have low presence in fights, they can push top constantly to be effective elsewhere. I said earlier that if the enemy team sends one to stop the split, then the pusher has done his job. This is because of this reason, that you\\'re pulling someone with high teamfight potential away from the team, the split pusher is considerably weakening the enemy team more than he is his own. \\n With that information, we\\'ll move back to Tryndamere. His team fighting is easily kited/shut down, his 1v1 potential is absurd, his wave clear is very strong, and his ability to escape while spamming Ctrl+4 is hilarious. All Trynd does is stay top and pushpushpush. If you send 1 to stop him, you\\'re already weakening your teamfight, and he can probably kill you. If you send 2, he can easily run away while your team gets engaged on 4v3. \\n >If you also then take into consideration that the enemy team has sacrificed a tank/bruiser role for an melee adc role they lack a wall in their frontline and engagement. \\n That\\'s no different than running Master Yi in the jungle, which is pretty common in all Ranks. With the jungler and the support usually building tanky while providing a large amount of CC, you have a front line. It\\'s not a necessary requirement to be tanky as a top laner. Vayne top vs Singed is a common counter. Riven is an  extremely  strong pick in every rating. \\n> ...and engagement \\n This is where I knew you didn\\'t know what split pushing is or how it works. If you comp around engaging teamfights with a split pusher, it is not the split pusher\\'s fault. That\\'s your fault. If you want to engage 4v5 and then blame your teammates, that\\'s all you. If you see a Teemo, Tryndamere or Shaco on your team, your initial reaction should not be \"FUCK THEY PICKED OUT OF THE SEASON 2 META OMG REPORT THEM I\\'M PICKING RAMMUS TO INITIATE DISADVANTAGEOUS TEAMFIGHTS\". It should instead be to comp around  dis engaging, stalling, and kiting. You should have someone who can initiate when they send 2-3 people top to stop your split pusher, but if the team isn\\'t stopping him, don\\'t you  dare  engage and blame. If you lose the teamfight that you engaged while in a poor situation, that is your poor judgement, not the person splitting.', summary=\"read it because it'll be educational for you.\", author='QQumberz', subreddit='summonerschool', tickers=['META'], sentiment=0.005148005206137896),\n",

       " Row(content='I think some people are against the GPL and Stallmanism, because it\\'s an ideology that\\'s at odds with the economies of software development and with the intent of the Law. \\n The above will no doubt sound inflammatory, but I will try to explain. Some background: \\n People have a notion that Copyright is an entitlement; that when you create a work, you are necessarily entitled to the protection afforded by so-called Intellectual Property. Stallmanists generally, and rightly, mock this notion by calling it \"Imaginary Property,\" since there is, in truth, no legal, moral, economic, or other basis for the idea that intellectual products are, somehow, property. (In fact, there are a number of studies and meta-studies that have demonstrated a strong negative correlation between co-called IP and economic growth; that strong IP laws are metaphorical poison to economies. To demonstrate this fact in a single sentence: Look at Bollywood and Hollywood, where India\\'s IP laws are substantially weaker than US IP laws, and yet there is greater creative output and economic mobility in Bollywood than Hollywood.) \\n The problem with this notion of entitlement is that it generally results in stagnation of the software industry in general, and a lower quality of proprietary software in particular. Part of the reason for this is that in order to be competitive, each market player must develop the intellectual capital and resources to rewrite common algorithms from scratch, needlessly duplicating effort. It also results in market players demanding increasingly high rents to cover their costs, as they duplicate more and more work. \\n It also, quite frustratingly, results in a software environment where new programmers require expensive training and education, since they are not able to learn from the software they use, which only further increases the costs of software development; and it makes it almost impossible to validate your tools against maliciousness, as without source code, you can\\'t verify that your software is without backdoors and not vulnerable to common exploits. \\n This is why the free software movement exists: To counter these malignancies of thought and of economy. \\n But it also led to the divide: Stallmanists on the one hand, who believe that to maintain the defense against these malignancies, Copyright must be short-circuited against itself to mandate openness at any cost; and BSDers (and those who commit to the Public Domain) on the other, who believe it\\'s sufficient to make the Copyright claim itself weaker, at the cost of less participation; and everyone else in the middle who are both uncomfortable with the uncompromising ideology of Stallmanism and the weakness of BSD\\'s lack of entitlement. \\n The economies of Stallmanism require that the Copyright claim be enforced, on the assumption that no one will contribute otherwise. In truth, that\\'s a fantasy: Companies contribute to the other end of the spectrum quite liberally; whether it\\'s Sun releasing Solaris under the CDDL, Google handing off code and projects to the Apache Foundation, or Sony contributing to the development of FreeBSD as part of their use of it in the PlayStation 4. Clearly, companies are willing to contribute to Free Software, and the strong Copyleft from the Stallmanist camp is at least partly unnecessary. \\n The reason for this is probably more complex than I give it credit, but the simplest explanation is that corporate entities are necessarily loathe to take the proprietary route simply because they\\'ve learned that it\\'s more expensive and requires more time and resources for development and maintenance. Open software solves half that problem by giving them a starting point, from which they can develop their solutions, without the massive startup cost for large projects. But GPL and LGPL software is similarly distasteful, because they have not yet learned the boundaries of the license, and what they are, or are not, required to publish of their source code. Business and managerial types are particularly uneducated on this point, especially as many trade magazines (most of which publish complete tripe, yet MBAs consider authoritative) have, over the years, disparaged the GPL as an infection that you can\\'t rid yourself of. \\n Individual developers are no better off. There is still the startup cost for complex projects and the costs of maintenance and other work. But it\\'s increasingly necessary to be an expert in licensing in order to determine whether a particular project\\'s license is compatible with yours. Given the massive array of confusing licenses, all written by asshole lawyers who use the most convoluted language possible (no offense, guys!), it\\'s difficult to tell that if something is GPL-compatible, whether it still requires additional work to comply with their licenses. The LGPL doesn\\'t make that any clearer, since the boundary of its linking exception isn\\'t clear. (In fact, there are a number of projects where the LGPL sounds like it makes sense, but it\\'s worse than the GPL plus a linking exception.) \\n The more pragmatic licenses in the middle of the spectrum (like the CDDL, Apache, etc.) are, in this regard, easier to understand, since many of them permit relicensing or are otherwise \"non-viral,\" and have a lower intellectual cost in their use. \\n But even public-domain software gets contributions back from its users. Why impose a restriction on its utility by licensing software under the GPL? \\n Stallmanists have an unreasonable ideal: That all software would be Free. That is unlikely to happen so long as the idea of Copyright being an entitlement remains. Because Stallmanism relies so heavily on Copyright to maintain its position, it\\'s at odds with the law (which encourages entitled protectionism) and with economies (which encourage openness - but not necessarily freedom - as a pragmatic necessity). \\n But the Law is also at odds with the economies of software development: Protectionism is a malignancy, and even corporations are learning this, as more and more contribute to open software. \\n My position is this: One day, we will all wake up and realize that Copyright is not a right - that it\\'s even dangerous and malignant - and people will continue sharing source code  as we have done since the beginning.', summary='Copyright bad, Stallman insane.', author='greyfade', subreddit='linux', tickers=['META'], sentiment=0.0029880478978157043),\n",

The Xbox One is scheduled for release across North America, several European markets, Australia and New Zealand on November 22, 2013, with later release in Japan and the remaining European markets in 2014. It will directly compete with Sony\\'s PlayStation 4 and Nintendo\\'s Wii U as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles.[10][11] Microsoft and various publications have classified the device as an \"all-in-one entertainment system,\" making it a competitor to other home media devices such as the Apple TV and the Google TV platform.\\nMoving away from the PowerPC based architecture used in the Xbox 360, the console features an AMD processor built around the x86-64 instruction set. The console places an increasing emphasis on entertainment and integration with the Kinect peripheral, offering the ability to use an existing set-top box to watch live television programming (augmented by an enhanced program guide with support for voice commands), a built-in Skype client, and improved second screen support. The console also provides new functionality for use in games, such as an expanded Xbox Live service, improved Kinect functionality, cloud computing, the ability to automatically record and share video highlights from gameplay, and integrated support for live streaming gameplay online.\\nThe console\\'s initial policies surrounding online connectivity requirements, mandatory integration with Kinect, and ambiguous restrictions on the resale and sharing of used games led to mixed reviews and concerns after the console\\'s reveal. In response to these criticisms, Microsoft announced they would be dropping all of the originally planned digital rights management and internet connection requirements, and the mandatory use of Kinect. The Xbox One\\'s exterior casing consists of a two-tone \"liquid black\" finish; with half finished in a matte grey, and the other in a glossier black. The Xbox One\\'s components were designed to evoke a more entertainment-oriented and simplified design than previous iterations of the console; among other changes, the LED rings used by the Xbox 360 are replaced by a glowing white Xbox logo used to communicate the system\\'s status to the user.[29]\\nThe Xbox One has an APU with eight x86-64 cores clocked at 1.75 GHz, based on the Jaguar architecture from AMD, and 8 GB of DDR3 RAM with a memory bandwidth of 68.3 GB/s. The memory subsystem also features an additional 32 MB of \"embedded static\" RAM, or ESRAM, with a memory bandwidth of 102 GB/s. Eurogamer has been told that for simultaneous read and write operations the ESRAM is capable of a theoretical memory bandwidth of 192 GB/s and that a memory bandwidth of 133 GB/s has been achieved with operations that involved alpha transparency blending. The system includes a 500 GB non-replaceable hard drive, and a Blu-ray Disc optical drive. Kotaku, Game Informer, and Gizmodo state that 3 GB of RAM will be reserved for the operating system and apps, leaving 5 GB for games. The graphics processing unit (GPU) is based on an AMD GCN architecture with 12 compute units, which have a total of 768 cores, running at 853 MHz providing an estimated peak theoretical power of 1.31 TFLOPS. For networking, the Xbox One supports Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11n wireless, and Wi-Fi Direct.\\nThe Xbox One will support 4K resolution (3840×2160) (2160p) video output and 7.1 surround sound. Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president of marketing and strategy for Microsoft, has stated that there is no hardware restriction that would prevent games from running at 4K resolution.

While the Frostbite 3 engine is more optimized for multithreading, the Battlefield 4 requirements so far have recommended an i5/i7 or an FX processor.

Moreover, Intel's processors are manufactured in a more advanced process (22nm vs. 32nm) and with other more advanced components, their processors are also running in many of these benchmarks with less energy as well.

This is where the runes system comes into play and changes the game for both players, the system allows for each player to choose the many different runes that compliments they specific playstyle. so we'll that the first player runs flat armor, armor per lvl, and flat AD runes with lifesteal quints. and we'll say that the other player plays more aggressive with attack speed, Flat AD, and life steal runes with life steal quints.

NB: I\\'m going to assume that men are preferenced and reason from there. \\n For the idea to work, we\\'d have to believe that employers are rational agents that use their rationality to have a \"...perfectly reasonable for the male to be preferred to some degree\" opinion.

That alone would mean men are more likely to be preferenced. If we extrapolate - in the way I am sure may employers would - that talented women will tend to divorce their loser husbands, that is a single mother with lots of extra constraints over the married man. So the married man is still a more rational choice. \\n \\n I\\'m not sure how much this one item explains wage differences.

       " Row(content='We must first be clear what we are talking about, capitalism is a method of PRODUCTION, it is not buying something for X and selling it for X+, its not what happens in shops but in factories. \\n One argument against capitalism as a form of production is that it is a form of slavery, wage slavery. Let me explain, in economics we use supply and demand diagrams, if we place \"number of people employed\" on the x axis and \"wage levels\" on the y we find that the only place we see everyone gets a job is when wages are at zero, thats slavery. Every other level of wages is just a degree of slavery. \\n On a similar note under capitalism in order to take part economically, buy the things we are told we need etc you HAVE to (workers have fought to get unemployment benefits but in general if you don\\'t sell your labour you starve) get a job (some can become capitalist but not all) yet every economic theory has an inbuilt number of unemployed, its called \"the natural rate of unemployment\". The unemployed keep the costs of labour down, if everyone needs a job bosses can get people at a lower wage, if everyone is employed the only way you get people to work for you is higher wages, higher wages mean lower profits. A system where everyone needs a job yet there is systemic unemployment and unemployment is a necessary feature is an immoral system. The capitalist exploits this for his own benefit at the expense of the worker. \\n Profit is defined as the difference between costs and prices, the only cost the capitalist can control is wages, wages and profit have an inverse relationship, one rises at the expense of the other, this causes a conflict between the two groups, class war. its an inherently divisive system. It also inverts the \"natural relationship\" of labour. let me explain, if you want your walls painting you ring a decorator who will come round,look at the job and tell you how much it will cost you. You don\\'t tell him how much you\\'ll pay, he decides what his labour is worth. under capitalism this is turned upside down, the boss tell you how much you\\'ll earn for selling him your labour. \\n Under capitalism, profit is king that means that what we get under this system is not necessarily the BEST products but the cheapest, two examples: VHS vs betamax, betamax was far superior to VHS, but VHS was cheaper so VHS became the dominant standard. When i was growing up Apple computers were far better than IBM ones, they have GUI, a mouse whereas IBM had MSDOS command line, but IBM were cheaper so it became dominant. Look at all the cheap shit in shops, pans that break within a few years vs lifetime guaranteed pans. Quality is reduced under capitalism cos its price and profit that matter not providing for people\\'s needs and wants. \\n Think of any social problem we have, you can easily think of ways to solve them but in policy terms there will always be economic (capitalist) reasons why it cant be done. For example, homelessness. do we know how to create homes? yes. so it seems easy, build home for the homeless, simples. But the capitalist will go \"No No, if we spend money building homes, that will raise the public sector borrowing requirement, that will mean more money in circulation, which will lead to inflation\". Inflation is their go-to excuse. We could solve the problem but the rules of capitalism wont let us do it.

Yeah, with the exception Sister, most of the female characters in the show are bitches or moody, but it fits with the scheme of how Red vs Blue works. Alpha was one of the more level-headed characters (as long as it doesn’t involve Tex) but is an asshole (anger management issues), Tucker is an easy-going and take in charge of rationality when Church isn’t but is also an asshole (his lewdness), Caboose is quite friendly/cheery and will try to get along with anyone that isn’t Tucker but is still an asshole (though more so in the earlier season where he was a bit more selfish and didn’t take responsibility for his actions. This later shifted away from being an asshole to not having common sense), and Tex being the strongest soldier excluding the Meta (who is a fusion of different equipment and AIs) but is also an asshole (being very greedy and mean. I mean, punching the team as they sleep for no reason?). They were all jerks or a glaring flaw for one reason for the other (I’m sure you can piece together how the Reds fit in this scheme). Up to season 9, all the characters had a good share of flaws that wasn’t didn’t feel like the writers were being sexist (^season 12 also has the same thing but in a different way). \\n The only really “sexist” characters I found were Tucker and Sarge but the show portrayed them in a good way. For Tucker, his lewd comments but as you mentioned, he gets called out for it or works against him: despite his supposed knowledge on girls, season 9 proves that he probably hasn’t ever dated or banged one (and interestingly enough, he is the one that gets pregnant). For  Sarge, he has a 50s sorta of stereotype which would include females being “weaker” or “in the kitchen” sort of view. He was the only character that commented how Tex not being a real female (or human).He doesn’t attack Sister in season 6 because she is a girl which Wash calls out on (despite this, he does fight Tex in season 8). Lopez even comments he couldn’t win a fight against a teenage girl. For both Tucker and Sarge, these traits aren’t really viewed as “positives” aspects of them (though you make a valid point Tucker’s Bow Chika Wow Wow comments have shifted away from it) \\n What bugged me in a lot of action-oriented shows was that most of the girls wore more skimpy or impractical armor compared to the guys. We don’t have that problem with this show because they all wear the same type of thing. It’s why we see a lot  less NFW material and lewdness in this community here than we see in /r/RWBY. Other problems I see (not in RWBY but other shows) is that half the reason a female character is there reason on the show is for boobs/sex, they start off strong but progressively become weaker while nothing happens to male characters, or they are all motivated by their love interest. What I love about Red vs Blue is that avoided this for the most part. While Carolina was a bitch, her motivation was to be recognized by father and that she took her job seriously (even if she was approaching it the wrong way). I enjoyed her rivalry and Tex in season 10 and found it really refreshing. After her conflict was resolved, you can see her character improve in season 12, she was wasn’t a bitch because she was her girl but because of her conflicts and character development (^note that in seaons 11-12 in general has all of the characters “better” traits outshine their flaws so it’s not specifically different about Carolina). In season 11/12, while Carolina was noticeably weaker to the badass she was before, Wash also suffers from it too (and Epsilon even comments that they weren’t fighting at their best). \\n About Tex’s agency in season 9, I though that because they were in the memory unit, all the characters were “hallucinations” for the BGC crew (Since the real ones were in the real world).

       " Row(content='4) Match-ups. Now this involves more meta-talk and is constantly evolving. But, essentially, with a tri-lane mid you apply much more pressure over-all to the entire map and immense pressure to the middle-lane unless they have at least a duo mid. As for blue, in the current meta, it would leave your AP to face ad/support bot lane on purple side and bruiser/whatever on top for blue side. This barely affects the blue-side match-up but for the purple-side matchup it limits the picking to long-range farmers. Which is great because lots of AP\\'s can do that. \\n Ok so essentially what you are assuming is that there will be 3 people (AD, support, support) putting pressure on the lanes from mid instead of the usual 2 (AP mid+jungle).  Well at any given time, one of the supports is going to want to be farming the jungle so you don\\'t lose xp in mid.  This essentially means your ganking team will consist of a support and an AD.  Early game AD\\'s just don\\'t do all that much damage, and most need time to get the maximum damage.  This does not equip them all that well for ganks, so they\\'ll be entirely reliant on CC from the support/solo\\'s to be able to get their damage out effectively, way moreso than an AP would since they have extremely high burst damage.  You will need heavy CC in top lane to make ganks effective.  Bot lane is a bit wierd, since ganks will be 3v2 instead of 3v1, against a sustain or CC -heavy support and an AD.  If the enemy support is smart they will attempt to shut down the AP so they can\\'t dish out their full burst and instapop the enemy AD while he runs, or else they will attempt to sustain the carry and run.  Meanwhile, it will essentially be your AD and support versus their fleeing AD.  It could go either way I suppose, I\\'m not going to run through all the possibilities here, but by ganking with an AD carry/support combo you NEED kills or else your carry will be heavily underfarmed, if you consider the matcup here, what you have is a support/AD versus support/AD/AP, which is more or less equivalent to an AP mid roaming to bot lane in the current meta. \\n >5) In the traditional meta the jungler will not be able to relieve pressure from a tri-lane. The 2 supports can split to each bot and top lane and double gank after clearing their respective sides of the jungle (or parts of it, mainly the buffs). The enemy jungler can only respond to relieve pressure from one of these lanes. As well the 2 supports from mid can invade extremely easily, completely shutting down the enemy jungle. \\n Assuming what I said above holds true and you have two tanky-support-junglers who have at least two gp10\\'s each, their ganks and clear times simply won\\'t be all that great.  The enemy team will see a solo ad carry mid lane, and know something is up since neither support is there an have been jungling/ganking all game.  Their lanes are going to play safe.  After a brief delay while the supports clear camps, a wild maokai appears top-lane!  at the same time, a wild nautilus appears bot lane!  Then they realize that each champion only has a gp10 and some components of the next, and is full level below the rest of team.  Their jungler can only respond to one of these ganks at most, but if they do it will probably be a successful counter gank since their supports are fairly weak, and the AP has gotten completely shut out of farm all game since hes struggling against a support/ad combo.  The other option for their jungler is to assume both ganks will fail since the supports are weak, and go for the now completely open, squishy AD carry in mid lane.  Now they have a standard jungler and underfarmed AP versus an underleveled AD, chances are it will be a successful gank.  One of the other (weaker) ganks will have to be successful to make up for the loss of the mid gank. \\n >6) Farm. What about farm? This is, ultimately, what some consider the most important point. This is false. The tri-lane lane is not a late-game strategy. The farm on the 3 \"main\" heroes (mid/bot/top) are roughly the same with the only one that changes is bot lane purple side with 2v1 ap but this is countered by your mid lane 2v1 or 3v1 their mid lane. Same reasoning as the current swaps between top and bot lanes. In every single case duo-lane mid is better than putting ad/support ANYWHERE else on the map. It is a strict improvement strategically. In a tri-lane, farm-wise, the 2 \"supports\" in mid will have less farm than a traditional jungle but more farm than a traditional support. This is the trade-off for an immense increase in map-wide pressure. The tri-lane also does not have to contain a traditional ad carry as the entire point of tri-lane is a fast, pressure heavy game. The game should be over by 20 minutes tops. \\n The main problem I see with this strategy is that it completely cripples the AP.  He\\'s forced into a 2v1 bot lane, and has no way of getting the farm he needs, although ideally he can stay ahead of the duo in levels if he doesn\\'t die to a gank.  If they pick an aggressive support, he stands no chance, especially if their jungler decides to gank as well.  The ganks he receives will not be strong enough to guarantee enough kills to snowball.  On top of that, AP mids are the most powerful gankers in the game, and by putting him bot you completely cripple his ability to roam top.  He could still potentially roam mid, but chances are he\\'ll be pushed to tower, preventing this from happening without risk of losing the tower early on. \\n This strategy revolves entirely around dominating early game, with an emphasis on shutting down their AP mid to prevent him from snowballing, while your AD carry get fed as many kills and farm as possible.  However, your AP carry is just as shut down in the process, and an AP\\'s are the strongest and most influential early/mid game champions out there.  AD carry\\'s struggle in early team fights since they just don\\'t have the items they need to deal effective damage yet.  On top of that, you are going to have two CC-heavy, but underfarmed and underleveled support/junglers whereas the enemy will have a full-fledged jungler and standard support, this does not bode well for a team fight.  Essentially; you will be entirely reliant on your top lane and your AD carry for damage, while they will have jungler, top lane, and AD for damage.  You are using an early game domination/control strategy, with mediocre early damage.

I'm old enough that [Cipher in the Snow]( was still being shown to every class in the later elementary grades, and the damned thing almost had me bawling in class due to extreme empathy for that poor kid. \\n I went a number of years as a child with 0 friends.  Absolutely none.  In fourth grade, I even wrote a short bit about how the one thing I wanted most in life was a friend.  Needless to say, reading that to the class (everyone had to read their bit in front of everyone else) didn't go over too well.  By the end of junior high, I had a couple.  By the end of high school, a handful. \\n A few years after high school, I was without friends again.  I found myself often drinking/smoking with people a few years younger than myself.  We would all be hanging out in the same public area day after day, nothing to do, and they realized I was old enough to by booze/cigarettes, and I was desperate enough for friends that I would do it with no qualms. \\n For years after that, I had people that were friendly towards me, but not really what you'd call friends.  After a few years of this, there were, again, a small handful that started to actually seem like friends, but I was usually in the back of the group, quietly watching everyone else's escapades, and stuck with intense feelings of emotional and physical loneliness despite the groups around me.  Hells, I'd have people consistently insist that I show up at a party, and when I got there most people seemed to pretend I didn't exist.  Whee.  During this time, I would sometimes (often) complain about my situation, and my feelings.  Time and time again, I was met with resistance, ridicule, disbelief, and argument.  People just plain didn't want to hear about it.  So I stopped talking entirely about it.  And the drinking got heavier.  Much heavier. \\n Then I became popular.  In my experience, few creatures are as social as an otherwise quiet, socially-awkward person when they've been in a party scene for a few years.  Those few times I would confide in someone about the loneliness, they were incredulous.  I was always so social when they saw me, they said.  I'm always drunk when you see me, I retorted.  I was one of those (un)lucky few who could drink more than average, and show it much less (regardless of how I was feeling it). \\n The last time I felt that way was a little over a year ago, after I stopped drinking.  Killed my social life, but really I don't mind.  Definitely been in worse situations before and survived, right?  And I'm not completely without friends.  Back to a handful yet again, and I'm actually content with it.  One of those being essentially a live-in lover definitely helps. \\n But even now... people rarely contact me to hang out.  They're often busy when I contact them (legitimate reasons, for the most part.  My paranoia has caused me to reason these things out pretty quickly, these days).  And nine times out of ten, I know that when someone gets in touch with me, it's because they want something other than just chilling.  A favor, a voice of support, etc.. \\n It's difficult to explain to people how, just because you're physically in a group with loosely-shared interests (mostly based around enabling each other with addiction), doesn't mean you're not lonely.  In point of fact, sometimes being surrounded by friendly people can drive home the loneliness, make you feel it much more intensely. \\n Well.  I did not mean to ramble on about my personal history quite so much, but there's a point to all of this. \\n If you're under 25, I honestly recommend you take up social drinking.  If you haven't already, spend a few weeks worth of nights drinking alone to find out what you can actually handle.  Then learn to consistently have less than that in social situations.  Remember not to drink fast, take plenty of water, and never drink on an empty stomach.  It will loosen you up, emotionally as well as physically.  But be ever mindful of it (recovering alcoholic bias in that, sure.  But also a few years worth of studying meta-programming and addiction in general), and try not to go overboard.

When you\\'re out of lane phase you should always be buying wards, especially when you\\'re team fighting. This is because the usefulness of potions caps out after laning phase. But like I was saying, the map is set up like LoL, but only more-so towards buff control. There are 6 buffs, 2 giant objectives. Not many people pay attention to these and take them casually unless you have two junglers or shit like that. Ward their jungle, always have the two big objectives warded (or at very least Fire Giant). Before a team fight, always have your tank take the speed buff or the HP buff. It helps a lot. Buff control is very important in this game but not a lot of people know it yet. The respawn time on all buff camps is 4 minutes while the respawn time on Fire Giant and Gold Harpe are 5 minutes. \\n \\n Practice in solo games as much as possible. I play Odin. I consider myself a pretty good Odin. I\\'ve played about 20\\'ish games with Odin in normal queue. I\\'ve probably played more than that in solo games. The point in solo games is getting used to the god or practicing skillshots. A lot of things, such as learning if a skill can go through a wall or not, is gamechanging if you try it out in a normal game. Solo games help you try out new builds, test your DPS, test out jungle speeds, help you learn to gank, and learn your god(s) overall. Every god has a different feel to play, and you need to recognize what that is to be good with a god in game. \\n \\n Do not have a single build for a god: Do not go into a game knowing what you\\'re going to build already unless their team\\'s damage is all one sided. I personally like to write down my builds for  gods and they usually take up the whole page because there are many different situation-dependent items that can be built. For casters this is not as much so, meanwhile for tanks it is the definition of being a tank. Items that I WOULD suggest getting every game though, assuming your game is going well, are the stacks that are not dropped upon death (Warlock\\'s Sash, Devourer\\'s Gloves, Gauntlet of Thebes) and either a Frostbound Hammer or a Gem of Isolation. The stacks that aren\\'t lost upon death are such good items that the price is almost worth half of what you get out of them. Don\\'t be afraid to build them as your 3rd or 4th item too. This is because the base values on these items is almost twice as much as what the stacks give you (Warlocks sash: 300 base health, 2+ for each stack, maximum of 80 stacks.) The reason for building the CC item is because they make you tanky which is important in this game, plus if your whole team does this it will make your team fights helluva effective. Maybe except on Artemis, because Frostbound Hammer reduces range on all ranged autoattacks. \\n \\n My fourth and final tip is that half the game is your mood or performance streak. If you start to lose, odds are you will become careless and in a pissy mood, making you prone to losing more and more easier. Meanwhile, if you get into a groove or \"on a roll\" you will notice you are just playing well. If you are on a roll, keep playing. Take note of what you\\'re doing right and don\\'t let it go to your head. Don\\'t get cocky.

And their performance in the last few tournaments hasn't been on a level where I could see them advancing past the quarter finals. \\n Invictus Gaming has beaten CLG.Prime online with 200 ping and I heard they are very good. But, I've also heard that, the Chinese meta, the junglers in particular, have a very small impact on the game and they rely primarily on their carries to bring the victory home. This is the opposite to western meta, where jungle presence is key and the junglers play a vital role in a team. Based on that I can't see the Chinese meta succeeding. The western junglers are too big of a threat to allow their carries to get farmed enough to carry the games. \\n Taipei Assassins have been regarded as the number one team in the world, based on their performance and their training regiment. But have fallen quite a long way from that since. Their fame has been almost entirely extinguished and I just can't see them starting a huge comeback at the Season 2 finals. \\n Najin Sword is considered the best Korean team by quite a few people, despite being behind Azubu Frost in circuit ranks. The reason for that is their flexibility, which Frost has not been able to show until now. Nhat Nguyen said a very interesting thing on SotL: Azubu Frost has only participated in Korean tournaments, which take place over the course of weeks with a lot of preparation time between matches, and they always know who to prepare for. This is an entirely different concept than the majority of the western tournaments have. You have to play a lot of consecutive matches in one day, against a variety of different teams. And I don't know if Frost has the flexibility to handle this situation, because up until now, they didn't have to. \\n CLG.Primes tournament performance in Season 2 was not the best they hoped it to be. They have struggled against Korean teams and seemingly didn't improve during their time there, because despite all the training, they are still second to TSM in their region. They have also struggled against Dignitas at the S2 NA Regionals, with one of the longest games in Season 2 LANs, suffering a 0:2 defeat. TSM then proceeded to obliterate Dignitas in the finals. CLG.Eu also has a notch above their North American counterpart and we will see if the training of these two teams will pay off in the end, based on how much they are streaming, I'm not so sure. \\n TSM could bring home a first place at every LAN event they attended, since they replaced TheRainMan with Dyrus, there is no doubt they are the strongest NA team. However, their showing against Azubu Blaze who failed to qualify for the finals against Najin Sword, suffering a 0:5 defeat, makes it hard to see whether or not they have prepared for the Korean and EU teams, who they themself say are ahead of the NA scene. \\n SK Gaming may have the most popular and prominent player in the world, but they still couldn't achieve even one victory in a LAN environent in the history of the team, with a lot of lineup changes over the course of Season 2, they seem to finally have a team that could potentially have a bigger impact at the Season 2 finaly than people are willing to give them credit for. They convincingly beat CLG.Eu at the European Regionals 2:0, which nobody expected.

The way you can approach this is (to save a bit of money) either you get a good unlocked cpu but on a bare-bones mobo, so that you at least won\\'t have to upgrade the CPU too (which may or may not be a good idea depending on when you will upgrade and when new CPUs arrive), or you get a good mobo now and a basic CPU and upgrade in the future, or you upgrade them all at once. \\n Of course, you also need better power-supply and a case. The latter being more of a pita to upgrade considering you have to re-build the system (not that big of a deal, but still an annoyance). Obviously though, the best bet is to invest first of all in these two components as they will carry across builds and are compatible with any future setup. \\n Lastly, I would advise against crossfire for a variety of reasons, but chiefly because you won\\'t be able to afford it without gimping your current build.', summary=\"OCing requires more than you have to spend, much the same for good upgrade paths. \\n PS: I'm going to bed but I'll respond in the morrow.\", author='OurHolyRue', subreddit='buildapcforme', tickers=['AMD'], sentiment=0.0),\n",

Must get 3GB or greater! \\n \\n Fact: When you play a 3D modeled game. Your monitor is piecing pixels (generally rectangular or squared) to create the illusion of curved planes. Antialiasing rectifies that by taking that \"staircase\" of pixels, and using algorithms to \"fill in\" the missing data in order to create a better illusion of a smooth curve. At 1440p/1600p, you are packing far more pixels per inch (or metric equivalent). That effectively increases the data that is being shown, and is making what would normally show up as \"jaggies\" on 1080p, less pronounced. Generally, when you have a 1440p screen, you are inevitably going to be turning down AA to something like 2x/4x MSAA (lightweight on VRAM usage), over maxing AA on your game at 1080p. You end up with a situation where you are using sometimes less overall VRAM due to not having to use those texture smoothing settings. \\nHowever. In terms of overall VRAM usage in gaming at 1440p/1600p, you are more likely to run out of brute force GPU power before you start hitting the VRAM limit of even 2GB.

       " Row(content='There was a big project a couple of decades ago (the name, unfortunately, eludes me right now) to do just that.  The goal was to create (or at least enable) AI by instantiating a set of rules to enable parsing and \"understanding\" of natural language.  I believe that after many years of effort, the attempt was either abandoned or vastly scaled back. \\n It turns out that the task is  huge . Much of \"natural\" language interpretation relies on contextual cues, sometimes multiple contextual cues. To be able to understand what is meant by a phrase or sentence, it is often important to understand many other things about the world, society, physics, etc., not to mention the situation, the intent of the speaker, etc.   Trying to put those understandings in place created a requirement for ever growing areas of knowledge to also be instantiated. \\n The researchers working on the project found that virtually every time they encountered a situation where contextual knowledge was needed and put it in place, it uncovered many more such areas. It was like peeling an onion, except every time you peeled off a layer, the underlying layer was larger. The task seemed to simply grow almost exponentially. \\n I don\\'t think that implies that the task was impossible, just that it was very difficult. Certainly humans have only a finite understanding of such things, but it is simply very large, complex, and interconnected.  We also rely on \"fuzzy\" logic systems and feedback loops that themselves may be chosen contextually, and may even be self-modifying. \\n It might be easier to do such a thing today with the resources that have been developed such as Wikipedia, large data mining techniques, etc.  Certainly IBM\\'s Watson has been able to be successful in certain areas. \\n But as a result of this effort and others like it, most researchers decided that it simply doesn\\'t make sense to try to create a huge body of information beforehand, but to instead rely more on a learning-based technique.', summary='It is \"better\" to teach the AI how to fish rather than giving it an ocean\\'s worth of fish.', author='afcagroo', subreddit='askscience', tickers=['IBM'], sentiment=0.0),\n",
